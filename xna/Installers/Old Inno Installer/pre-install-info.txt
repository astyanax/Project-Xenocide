Xenocide v. 0.4.0.1836 Progress release installer

PLEASE READ THIS!

This setup programm will install the computer game "Xenocide", developed by the "Project Xenocide" Team on your computer.
"Xenocide" is based on the XNA framework, thus you will need a few prequesites.

You have 2 ways to make sure you can run XNA games:
    1) Select all prerequisites to be downloaded during installation and RUN THEM MANUALLY after the installation finishes - you will find them right on your desktop
    OR
    2) Don't select any prerequisites and run the automatic XNA Requirements Checker/Installer at the end of the installation process

Additionally you will be able to download a better globe texture and the audio pack via this installer. Both will automatically be installed once downloaded. 

THIS IS A PROGRESS RELEASE, NOT A FULLY PLAYABLE VERSION!!!!
