Porting notes for CeGui#

This file contains important informations about the porting process.


== File Names ==

The file names have been changed to include the original CeGui file names. This makes
it easier to see where a specific ported class originated from.

The following simple scheme is used to translate from the original file names to the
CeGui# ones: Take the 'include/CEGUIUDim.h' and 'src/CEGUIUDim.cpp' combination for
example, containing three C++ classes: UDim, URect and UVector2.

In CeGui#, this should translate to these files:

  * CEGUIUDim.cs - contains no code but only porting informations. Here porters can
                   leave messages and important informations about why and how some
                   things where ported to their successors

  * CEGUIUDim.UDim.cs - the code for the UDim class
  * CEGUIUDim.URect.cs - the code for the URect class
  * CEGUIUDim.UVector2.cs - the code for the UVector2 class

Sometimes it's reasonable not to port a class because there already is a pretty good
equivalent in the .NET framework. In this case, just create the file with the
porting informations as shown above and leave a message telling which .NET framework
class you're using instead.


== Class and Variable Names ==

Try to keep as close to the original as possible but adjust casing to match the standard
.NET framework coding guidelines, which are:

  * Protected or publicly visible identifiers use NormalCase names
  * Private identifiers (with the exception of classes) use camelCase names


== Markers ==

Do a full-text search for "TODO" in the code. Things that are not fully ported, need
additional thinking and the like have been marked with this tag

Do a full-text search for "not implemented" or "NotImplemented". Dummy methods that
have not been ported yet will typically throw a NotImplementedException


== Exceptions ==

NullObjectException -> ArgumentNullException
InvalidRequestException -> ArgumentException
UnknownObjectException -> UnknownObjectException
