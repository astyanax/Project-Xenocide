Step vs. Step Light
-------------------
The "Step" set includes a low reverberated footstep to convey the weight of the Morlocks.
It is intended to complement the primary generic footstep, which should be played simultaneously.
In case the reverberated footstep clashes with the generic footstep, I've included a "Step light"
set, which contains exactly the same samples, but with the reverberated footstep removed.  It may be
that each sample set sounds more realistic with certain surface footstep sets.

Death vs. Death Thud
--------------------
Similarly, the only difference between the "Death" and "Death thud" sets are some added samples of
limbs hitting the floor in the "thud" set.  I included both because I am uncertain whether samples
will be played for the aliens hitting the floor when dying.


example.ogg
-------------
-The file "example.ogg" is an example of the samples as they are intended to be combined in the game.
-Temporary (read: not in the repository) samples were used for primary footsteps (wood and metal surfaces).  
-Note that 3 battlecries are played simultaneously (at staggered start times) from center, hard left, 
 and hard right.  
-Use this file as a reference for playing "breath" (accompanying walking here) and "panic" (accompanying 
 running here) samples together.
