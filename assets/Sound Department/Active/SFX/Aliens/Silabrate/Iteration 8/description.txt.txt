This is intended as a complete, usable sound set for Silibrates.  At the time of this writing, there's still some ambiguity as to how things will be implemented, so I've included both individual Move samples, and longer, loopable Move sample - use whichever is more convenient in implementation.

I have ONLY included a single loop for the "At Rest" sample type - it should be played continually, as long as the silibrate is alive.
