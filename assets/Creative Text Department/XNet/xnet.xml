      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Superficially like a conventional aircraft, the XC-1 Gryphon is anything but conventional - it outperforms all other previous designs by decades. This is primarily due to technological advances in hydrogen technology, the development of Electro Active Polymers Actuators, and its advanced avionics and weapons systems design.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Late in the 20th century, it was foreseen that the world's dwindling petroleum resources would only last, at most, another 40-50 years. Thus, scientists began experimenting on hydrogen-based engines, and shortly after the turn of the century several working prototypes had been developed. These prototypes produced 3 times the energy output of petroleum-based engines of the same size and weight. Years of refinement and the use of pulse detonation techniques of combustion have increased this output two-fold.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, the real problem of hydrogen engines was fuel storage. Hydrogen must be kept at -259,2 ?C to maintain its liquid state. And even as such, it required four times the volume of petroleum fuels this made hydrogen-based vehicles too bulky for practical military use.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Recent breakthroughs made in carbon nanotube technologies have made the storage of hydrogen at standard pressure and temperature feasible. Basically, scientists have discovered a method of infusing nanotubes into metal hydrides for use as fuel cells; the concept of this storage system is similar to that of a sponge. The nanotube-infused metal hydride fuel cell can absorb up to 70% of its weight in hydrogen. Releasing of this hydrogen is achieved through thermal excitement of the storage system. This has eliminated the need for the excessively large tanks needed to store liquid hydrogen, and prevents unwanted detonation while the hydrogen is stored. As such, the XC-1 is the first military aircraft to make use of the new fuel storage system, and it is the first production aircraft to make use of hydrogen engines.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Another technological advancement introduced in the Grypon is the first time usage of Electro Active Polymer Actuators in an aircraft. Electro Active Polymers are manufactured carbon-based materials that contract and expand in the presence of an electric field. Before the XC-1, previous polymer actuator designs required ludicrous amounts of electricity to stimulate even the smallest movements. The key was to create a polymer with a lower dielectric constant in order to reduce the amount of electricity required. Scientists discovered that infusing silver ions in the polymer increased its dielectric constant more than 700 times, thus reducing its energy needs by the same factor. In the Gryphon the old hydraulic system of conventional aircraft has been replaced by electric wires and polymers. This not only makes the XC-1 lighter and more space efficient, but multiplies the aircraft's response rate to near organic levels. Combined with variable control configuration technology and the ability to Vector in Forward Flight (VIFF), the XC-1 is agile beyond what was previously thought possible.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Additionally, the XC-1 uses advanced telemetric and AlphaWave technology to enhance its fly-by-wire flight controls. This makes the XC-1's response rate 0.3 seconds faster than conventional fly-by-wire controls. This is also the basis for its advanced weapons targeting systems. Combined with its advanced phase variance rotating Doppler scanner and IR imaging radar systems, the XC-1 possesses unprecedented detection, identification and targeting capabilities. As such, Gryphons can track, identify and lock on a target the size of a football at ranges beyond 120,70 kilometers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Truly an impressive leap in military aircraft technology, the XC-1 represents the current pinnacle of aircraft design, and it will be essential in the battle to defend Earth from the Alien menace.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>XC-2 STARFIRE</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Craft/NewGeneration/Starfire</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Starfire interceptor is X-Corps' first attempt at creating an aircraft based on newly researched Alien technology. Possessing superior top speed and damage tolerance to even the most sophisticated Earth-based craft, the Starfire is the first real aerial threat that the Alien menace must contend with.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As the war with the Alien force continues, it has become apparent that our standard interceptors are unable to cope with the ever-increasing size and frequency of Alien vessels. This has led to the research and implementation of a new form of interceptor craft. Dr. Gregor of the Research Division proposed the implementation of Alien technology on modern craft, giving the X-Corps a viable interception craft, which would maximize the use of thrust, and create a craft capable of achieving speeds in excess of any current Earth-based craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Using cutting edge technology, the XC-2 was designed with a central Xenium-122 based reactor powering its systems. The reactor core provides an abundance of power, with waste particles being vented into the XC-2’s fuel tank. The resulting combination gives the engines more thrust than ever before seen in a fighter craft. In addition, Xenium-122’s inherent gravitational properties allow the Starfire to achieve a “zero-movement” hover state. This allows the craft to be built without cumbersome landing gear, allowing extra hull space for craft systems.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The shape of the Starfire is reminiscent of failed ‘flying wing’ designs, used as a basis for Air Force concepts in the late 1950s. Use of Alien Composites and Xenium-122 allows the Starfire to succeed where initial delta wing designs failed. Alien technology makes the XC-2 a much more robust craft than our current interceptors, allowing it to sustain a considerable amount of extra damage before being destroyed. Much of this can be attributed to the damage dispersion properties of the Alien Composites plates. Similar to the chain mail of ancient warfare, the skin of the Starfire disperses thermal and kinetic energy along the length of the craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Starfire is equipped with two forward weapon mounts situated to the left and right of the cockpit, and unlike the XC-1 Gryphon, the Starfire was built with the increased power needs of new weapons in mind. A pilot will find the weapon power meter situated on lower right of his HUD, giving an accurate and constant representation of the flow of energy to his forward mounted weapons systems. These hard points are suitable for any craft weapon, although heat-based weaponry prove to be well suited for use with the Starfire. The extreme heat put out during extended engagements is easily dissipated throughout the hull of the craft. (For more info on the heat dispersion properties of the hull, see X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Craft/Components/Alien Composites)</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to our relative inexperience working with Xenium-122 based propulsion systems, and our very basic understanding of its power-giving reaction; the Starfire is unable to stay aloft for long periods of time. While the Xenium-122 system allows for unheard of speeds in an Earth-based craft, fuel consumption is extremely high. As such, it should be used as a quick and decisive strike craft against an enemy UFO, and not as a long-range reconnaissance craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In laboratory field tests, the Starfire has performed well, but a few problems were found during initial flight procedures. Besides the high fuel consumption of the engine, the maneuverability of the craft was far less than was needed for a new interceptor design. It seems that at the speeds reached by the Starfire, it was unable to compensate for the quick turns and ‘jerks’ so common when chasing a UFO. This flaw was rectified by installing an intricate thruster system across the hull of the craft. The main engine applies forward thrust, while smaller ‘micro thrusters’ adjust the orientation of the craft in the transverse directions. The micro thrusters are operated using a variant of the Alpha Wave neural command system used in our Heavy Weapon Platforms. Using speed-of-thought commands, the pilot can effortlessly use the Maneuvering Thrust System (MTS) to slide the Starfire smoothly in any direction, adjusting its orientation as necessary, without losing the forward thrust given off by the main engine.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A second problem was encountered after the installation of the MTS. The extreme Gs pulled when executing quick turns in the Starfire led to internal trauma in the pilot, resulting in the Avionics Department beginning implementation of a Motion-Dampening Field within the craft. Using the basic ideas behind UFO propulsion systems, it was determined that gravity could be manipulated within the aircraft. Small deposits of Xenium-122 surround the cockpit of the XC-2, each connected to the central power system. Gyroscopes and the navigation system match changes in craft direction by modifying the gravitational fields inside the cockpit. This effectively holds the pilot in place and reduces the effective G-forces he feels to a survivable level. In this weightless environment, the pilot of the Starfire can execute a variety of seemingly death-defying loops and turns and feel no additional load factors on his body. Injury and stress to the pilot are completely eliminated, allowing him to function at optimum capacity. Further research into the area of Applied Directional Gravity Fields could prove fruitful.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With the installation of the MTS and the Motion Dampening Field, the Starfire's usefulness as an interceptor craft becomes undeniable. While the hybrid engine design of the XC-2’s energy/propulsion system seems to be a failure, it has given us deeper understanding of how to implement the Xenium reactor in future designs. It is the recommendation of the Research Division that the Starfire be put into regular service as soon as possible. </paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Craft/Transports/XC-11 "Condor"</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The XC-11 "Condor" is a Vertical/Short Take Off/Landing (VSTOL) transport craft is based on the obsolete Osprey tilt-rotor design. Recent technology breakthroughs and architectural improvements have resulted in a craft that is not only faster than any other transport craft of its class, but also capable of carrying more payload further than most similar crafts. The XC-11 also features titanium alloy armor-plating, providing our troops and equipment with superior protection from small arms fire.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In the late twentieth century, a redesign of the outmoded Osprey VSTOL was deemed necessary by the U. S. Military command. The design specifications for the new aircraft called for sufficient transport capabilities for twenty fully equiped equipped "Land Warrior" infantry, improved airspeed, and increased range. In spite of the demanding design requirements, the new XC-11 "Condor" design, to the surprise of many, not only met the design requirements, it even exceeded many of them.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The XC-11 "Condor" shares many design similarities with it's predecessor, in particular the twin rotatable outboard engines located at the wingtips. However, where the Osprey depended on turboshaft driven rotors for propulsion, the Condor relies upon twin experimental supercruise-capable turbofans instead. The dual turbofan engines provide enough thrust that the Condor can be equipped with an extra two inches of titanium alloy armor and still achieve vertical take-off, even when fully loaded. Despite being equipped with additional armor, the Condor remains the fastest VSTOL transport currently in service.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Condor is also capable of carrying an impressive amount of fuel in tanks located in the wings and wingroots. As a result, the Condor is capable of staying aloft for extended periods of time before refueling, resulting in a maximum range unmatched by any other VSTOL transports. As required by the design specifications, the Condor can carry twenty fully equipped infantry soldiers. Also, as an alternative loadout, the XC-11 design allows up to two newly developed remotely-operated weapons platforms to be carried along with twelve fully equipped soldiers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As the XC-11 "Condor" meets the stringent requirements that the X-Corps Taskforce demands of its transport aircraft, it has been adopted as the official X-Corps Transport until better alternatives become available.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>XC-22 ECLIPSE</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Craft/NewGeneration/Eclipse</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The XC-22 Eclipse Fighter-Transport aircraft is an advanced, Alien-based, replacement for the XC-11 troop transporter. Possessing a very high top speed, the Eclipse also sports a single weapon pod for limited combat capabilities. For weight and speed reasons the Eclipse is unable to transport any sort of XCAP, limiting it to X-Corps operatives only. With vastly superior capabilities to any Earth-based vehicle currently in service, the Eclipse fighter-transport aircraft is a mighty weapon in the war against the Alien menace. Production of these awesome craft would greatly aid our cause.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With the advent of fighter aircraft based on advanced Alien technologies and components, it was only a matter of time before a troop transport derivative was engineered that took full advantage of these technological developments. Representing the first time an Alien aircraft design has been innovated rather than replicated, the Eclipse troop transporter is a faster, more maneuverable, and more reliable transport than the XC-11 model. It surpasses Earth-based counterparts by leaps and bounds.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Initially, the Eclipse was to be a refitted XC-11 design. However, after the obvious superiority of Alien technology became clear to the X-Corps designers, a shift towards a design featuring core Alien characteristics was inevitable. This craft utilizes the same basic components as any other Alien vessels; namely a Xenium Reactor, Alien Navigation Systems and a structure composed of Alien Composites. By applying knowledge gained from the XC-2 StarFire project, engineers were able to hybridize Human design with superior Alien technology to create a ship that puts X-Corps in a position to represent a considerable threat to the Alien menace. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Eclipse uses a heavily modified UFO chassis as a design base. The need for a cargo bay large enough to carry an entire complement of X-Corps soldiers into battle ensured that the overall size of the Eclipse would be significantly larger than its XC-2 Starfire counterpart. Because of all this, certain compromises were required in terms of flight performance. The Xenium Reactor had to be shifted forward, which in turn affected the rate of energy transfer between it and the engines. Consequently, engine performance is slightly lower in the Eclipse when compared to the XC-2 StarFire, which translates into a lower top speed. Since our understanding of Alien technology is still only rudimentary, no solution to this problem has been put forward yet. However, this is of little importance since the Eclipse far outperforms the XC-11 in both V.T.O.L capabilities and in maximum cruise velocity. Given that the Eclipse is designed as a troop transport first and fighter craft second, it is this ability that is of paramount importance to X-Corps.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Because so much room needed to be reserved for cargo, there were concerns among the X-Corps engineers that the Eclipse's maximum takeoff weight would simply be too much for it to bear. However, giving true testament to the undisputed supremacy of the Xenium-based reactors and engines, initial field tests of the first Eclipse prototypes exceeded vertical thrust requirements by over 320%. In essence, there were absolutely no concerns about this craft's ability to airlift troops to a designated hot-spot landing zone.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While certainly not intended as a heavy assault craft, the Eclipse is still equipped with a single weapon pod, located under the nose of the aircraft. X-Corps felt it was in the best interests of the Eclipse for it to have offensive/defensive capabilities. Although initial designs features two weapon pods, just as in the XC-2 StarFire, it became apparent later that a redesign was required due to the unforeseen complications related to the safety of the passengers aboard. In the event of a catastrophic weapon pod malfunction, the resulting explosion could potentially cause significant harm to the occupants of the cargo hold. In order to ensure that the troops on board reach their destination with the lowest degree of risk, a single nose-mounted weapon pod was decided to be the best configuration for the Eclipse. Although this limits the ability of the Eclipse to serve as an interceptor, it does not affect its design mission in any way. Furthermore, the craft is unable to safely and easily accommodate X-Corps Assault Platforms due to its limited size. Increasing the structure to support XCAPs as well as a compliment of troops would have significantly impacted flight performance. The entire science team hopes that this issue will be addressed in future aircraft designs. However, this weakness is a small price to pay for increased speed and firepower ultimately inherent to the Eclipse.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Craft/NewGeneration/Vengeance</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The XC-33 "Vengeance" Ultimate Assault Transport spacecraft represents the culmination of both Human engineering and Alien technology. Possessing a higher top speed, greater damage resistance, both atmospheric and space flight capabilities, and longer active range than virtually any terrestrial or Alien ship in existence, the Vengeance ensures X-Corps' dominance of the skies. The Vengeance also ensures tactical assault superiority by allowing X-Corps to transport more troops and XCAPS into battle than any other craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The XC-33 truly is the ultimate X-Corps craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Vengeance represents the evolutionary pinnacle of hybrid Human-Alien technology. Finally, X-Corps research into the nature of Alien power systems and UFO components have led to the creation of an assault craft that outmatches all known craft. With vastly superior maneuverability, speed, and firepower to match, the Vengeance's ability to successfully dominate any conceivable aerial or spatial encounter with Alien ships has brought victory closer than it has ever been.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Visually, the Vengeance shares little resemblance with existing designs. The ship itself is unique in its type; it is neither truly Alien nor entirely Earth-based, it carries heavy armament yet still serves as a troop transport far superior to our old XC-11 and even the more recently developed XC-22, all while flying at unparalleled speeds; the Vengeance is in a category all of its own. Issues that plagued previous designs have either been remedied or circumvented, resulting in a craft that offers aerial superiority while demonstrating no obvious weaknesses. Despite utilizing the same basic components found in any Alien craft, the Vengeance design succeeds in making use of Alien technology to a much higher potential compared to previous crafts based on UFO designs. As our exhaustive research has yielded a complete and thorough understanding of Alien architecture and technology, the X-Corps have finally been able to achieve the fundamental paradigm shift from mere mimicry to intelligent and optimized design. The final result was the transcendent development of the XC-33 Vengeance. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Vengeance requires Alien Composites for its basic hull construction, and our now deep understanding of the Composites’ applications in air/spacecraft technology has allowed us to employ their special properties more efficiently with regards to hull design. The XC-33’s streamlined contours and enhanced surfaces serve to minimize drag, while the sleek hull of the craft is optimized for absorbing enemy fire and redistributing along the entire length of the fuselage. Unlike the XC-2 Starfire, greater emphasis is placed on the superconducting layers of the Alien Composites, resulting in greater heat dispersion than the Starfire could never hope to achieve. In actuality, the Vengeance's deceptively thin sheath of armor belies its extensive damage absorption potential, since much of the effective energy of incoming enemy fire is dissipated harmlessly. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>In order to accommodate its enormous power requirements, the Vengeance is the first X-Corps craft to be fitted with dual Xenium Reactors. Although we may never truly unlock the mysteries of Xenium-122 without tracing it back to its source, what we have discovered about its mechanics allows us to use Xenium Reactors quite effectively. After analyzing the shortcomings and design flaws in both the XC-2 Starfire and XC-22 Eclipse classes of Alien-based aircraft, X-Corps engineers were able to fully address and rectify the power transfer balance issues inherent in the XC-33’s predecessors. As such, the Vengeance is able to make full use of the Xenium Reactors to gain maximum thrust. Combined with the streamlined, aerodynamic design of the Vengeance, the ultimate result is a craft that can outrun and outmaneuver any craft in existence, be it Human or Alien in origin.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to the overall larger size and extreme thrust potential, virtually all problems in the Eclipse design regarding troop transport were effectively eliminated. Consequently, the XC-33 is able to carry twice as many X-Corps soldiers as the old XC-11 Condor. The Vengeance also addresses a major stability issue that prevented the XC-22 craft from carrying XCAPS. Additionally, the high vertical thrust capabilities of the gravity wave unit in the Xenium-based engines allow up to four XCAPS to support X-Corps assault teams; more than any other craft. This newly configured gravity wave system, while used to great effect in the Vengeance, might have other applications within the X-Corps, perhaps even in such fields as base defense.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Vengeance is equipped with the standard complement of two craft weapon pods. Although structurally the Vengeance can easily tolerate additional weapons systems, Engineering focused instead on maximizing transport volume to provide our ground squads with the maximum XCAPS support, effectively balancing the Vengeance’s air superiority capabilities with ground superiority potential. Even with only two weapons, the Vengeance’s specifications remain quite impressive, and it is still more than a match for existing craft. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Another key difference between the Vengeance and other X-Corps craft is its ability to safely function in a zero-gravity vacuum. This feature was prioritized in order to ensure the Vengeance’s operative capabilities in all environments, particularly extraterrestrial ones, thus allowing the X-Corps to switch from a purely defensive posture to an offensive one. It is inevitable; we need the ability to fight outside our atmosphere if we are to successfully counter the Alien threat. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Able to single-handedly accomplish any mission the X-Corps may require, the Vengeance is the single greatest asset to the Xenocide Project. With unmatched capabilities, regular deployment of the Vengeance may ultimately be what turns the tide of this war against the Alien species. Science and Engineering both recommend ramping up the production of the Vengeance to hasten their implementation.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Until recently aerial dogfights were fought with 20-30mm machine guns. As planes eventually became faster and more difficult to hit, guided missiles became more practical than machine guns, and the usage of projectile weapons was largely relegated to Air-to-Ground purposes. Prior to the creation of Project Xenocide, nations attempting to initiate anti-Alien programs noted their null success in Air-to-Air combat with UFOs, primarily because of the UFOs' superior speed or the inadequate power of Human missiles and standard 20-30mm rounds. The development of the Titan and Sidewinder missiles improved the situation, but both missiles had an extremely slow rate of fire due to the necessity of storing them inside the hull for aerodynamic reasons; this meant that instead of just arming and firing, the missile launcher had to be physically "reloaded".</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The six-barrel, 20mm cannon was developed to partially address these concerns. Its range will never surpass that of missiles, but its virtue is its ammunition capacity; in extended firefights, a pilot can always fall back on a cannon long after the missiles have been exhausted. It is capable of firing 600 rounds per minute by using electro-magnets to accelerate the bullets. The rare Earth magnets embedded along the length of the barrel allow bullets to reach speeds in excess of 4,500 meters/second. Although railguns propel bullets much faster and farther than regular guns, their rate of fire is sacrificed in the process. Normally, the volume of fire would not be nearly enough to critically damage supersonic aircraft, but between the high speed of the round (which reduces the time spent in transit) and the advances in computer-assisted aiming, accuracy has been improved significantly. However, pitted against the incredibly high speed and maneuverability of UFOs, the low firing rate of a railgun-based cannon is still a liability; putting rounds on target remains difficult. With current technological limitations, this tradeoff of rate-of-fire for speed-of-projectile is necessary in order to create a kinetic projectile imbued with enough force to punch through the UFOs’ armored hulls. Computer-assisted aiming focuses the cannon’s fire across the UFO's flight path to increase the chances of hitting the target</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Despite its shortcomings, the cannon is the first weapon of its class to achieve effective strikes on an UFO, and we should still consider its capabilities in countering the present menace.</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>Given the nature of the electromagnets, care must be taken to magnetically shield sensitive equipment on board the aircraft, limiting the total amount of ammunition it can carry to 200-20mm bullets. The bullets themselves are tipped with depleted uranium, allowing them to pierce armor more effectively than lead bullets. Using the cannon in conjunction with a missile system allows the target to be weakened at a distance before the cannon delivers the coup de grace at close range.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Despite the successful application of our standard sub weaponry like the "Titan" and the "Sidewinder" missile systems or the Cannon, there are still major drawbacks and limitations in their usage. The cannon is extremely short-ranged and inaccurate, rendering it effective only against small UFOs. Also, both standard missile systems have inadequate fire rates and can carry very few bulky and expensive missiles, which swamp the available storage space.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With the development of increasingly more powerful laser weaponry, our scientists realized that laser systems have become effective enough to be practical in aerial combat due to their superb armor piercing capabilities. A strong laser-based weapon would have more shots than a cannon and be as powerful and accurate as a Sidewinder, without the need for any guidance systems. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>"It's like shooting fish in a barrel compared to the old cannon system" -veteran pilot Jim Lumbeck.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The beam dispersion is virtually negligible for distances involved in firing X-Corps infantry laser weapons on the battlefield. In the larger craft-mounted version, the laser beam must propagate a far longer distance, and any minute focal imperfections would scatter its energy long before it reaches the target. By using additional focusing diamond lenses in our craft-mounted laser cannons, however, the beam dispersion is minimized so efficiently that its deviation is still within five centimeters for targets as far as 21 kilometers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The laser cannon is powered by an array of high-performance capacitors which are charged in X-Corps bases prior to each mission.

        <paragraph>The plasma cannon is a product of X-Corps research into the Aliens' plasma weaponry, and represents the first human plasma weapon design. The research team has done its work well - the plasma cannon easily outperforms every conventional weapon system in terms of damage output, and outranges them all save for the Titan missile. Unlike other plasma weapons, the plasma cannon does not require separately manufactured clips. Instead, it includes a system which performs all of the required processing, allowing the reactants to be pumped directly into the cannon's storage tanks.  </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The X-Corps has improved the efficiency, muzzle velocity, and range compared to personnel plasma weapons, and added mechanisms to evenly mix reactants and fire plasma under combat flight conditions. The system is stable enough to allow operation under velocities and accelerations far greater than standard military craft are able to achieve. X-corps researchers have also increased the size of the cannon far above that of a handheld device, and redesigned the ammunition system to allow for clipless operation.  While aircraft mass and volume limitations dictate that only a finite amount of ammunition can be carried, its 99 shot capacity should be sufficient for any encounter.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The ammunition system has been totally refurbished, and is more complex than its predecessors. Adding ammunition is a three-step process simple enough to be performed by even the most inexperienced aircraft maintenance crew member. First, Xenium is placed inside a small chamber located on the side of the cannon, where it is fractured into powder by an integrated X-ray laser. A mixture of shredded uranium, iron, and carbon is added to the powderized Xenium to form a gel. The addition of highly-purified heavy water to the gel completes the ammunition loading process. Due to the potential danger of plasma destabilization, the cannon includes systems to automatically test all materials for purity before use. Though the radiation dosage from the uranium component is infinitesimal, all crewmembers are required to wear radiation counters and adhere to standard radiation safety precautions.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Aside from the above-mentioned alterations, the plasma cannon operates in the same manner as handheld plasma weapons, with the usual two-mixture ammunition and EM-triggered explosion. Eight magnetodynamic prongs collimate the burst.  The Xenium in the plasma burst is slowly expended even after the shot leaves the barrel, but enough is present in each burst to maintain a coherent gravity bubble for 52km. This gravity bubble bursts upon striking the target, releasing the superheated contents.  The plasma then spreads outward rapidly and consumes any materials in its wake.  Although we expect UFOs to possess some partial immunity to plasma weaponry due to the heat-resistant nature of Alien Composites, the incredible power of the plasma cannon ensures that an impressive amount of damage will be inflicted. Against Alien Composites, the plasma cannon is 10x as effective as a Sidewinder, and 6.5x as effective as a Titan, before considering differences in range or ammunition capacity.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A scaled-down plasma cannon could conceivably be mounted on an XCAP.  However, preliminary research indicates that a conventional, treaded XCAP, although able to support the weight of the equipment, would be difficult to maneuver and would run a high risk of being stuck in difficult terrain.  Research into the design principles of UFO's may lead to new XCAP designs that can address these concerns.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Using insights gained from analyzing the alien Gravity Distortion Drone weapon system, we have been able to create a similar, yet more powerful weapon system for use in our craft. The system uses the same inverted-gravity field technology as the GDD, but the gravity distortion system has been integrated into the projectile itself, allowing in-flight course correction. We have therefore dubbed it "Gravitational Active Interception Armament" or GAIA. In effect, the GAIA missiles are autonomous self-propelled fire-and-forget weapons, not unlike cruise missiles, but with the speed and maneuverability of a UFO.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The GAIA Launcher features a sensor array especially designed to extrapolate the direction and speed changes of a moving UFO by monitoring its engine output. The information about target heading and projected position is relayed to the GAIA missile, which then changes its own trajectory accordingly, increasing the chances of hitting a UFO executing evasive maneuvers. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Early prototype simulations with an integrated warhead sensor system revealed a serious limitation in target identification subroutines at high relative velocities, one which occasionally caused GAIA missiles to loop back and attack the launching craft.  As a result, the sensor system was incorporated into the launcher. This semi-autonomous system has proven to be most effective.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The "warhead" of a GAIA missile is, just like in a GDD, the engine itself. By de-stabilizing the Gravity-Distortion systems, a large part of the contained energies is converted into devastating gravitational shear stress, while the rest dissipates in a plasma explosion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Compared to the GDD, a more powerful design of the Xenium engine was developed to allow greater range and higher speeds. This consequently results in a much higher energy output when melting down the reactor core, substantially increasing the damage inflicted.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The destructive force unleashed by a single GAIA missile is enough to seriously damage medium-to-large UFOs and often entirely destroy small ones.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With this weapon we have a destructive tool at hand that approaches 100% accuracy and delivers enough damage to down or destroy most UFOs. The range of this weapon system is phenomenal, and outclasses that of every other craft weapon system at our disposal.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>There are drawbacks, however: Because of the intricate technology involved, the GAIA Launcher as well as the GAIA missiles are expensive in construction. The GAIA missiles also require Xenium for production, and because of their weight and bulk, the ammunition capacity of the GAIA launcher is very limited.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Sidewinder III is currently the best medium-range Air-to-Air missile (AAM) in the world. It has the necessary firepower to devastate most small to medium-sized craft easily and quickly. Its relatively short range (in comparison to other medium-range missiles) is only a minor hindrance; longer ranged missiles should be used in BVR (Beyond Visual Range) engagements. The payload of six missiles per bay means that a fully stocked XC-1 can carry twelve missiles, providing enough ammunition to conclude most low to mid intensity engagements.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>An adaptation of the Sidewinder AAM, the Sidewinder III has had endured a troublesome design process. During the Neo-Russian revolution coup, an unscrupulous arms dealer named Carlos Carroll-Teal sold a number of Sidewinder missiles (and other weapons) to the revolutionaries. After the formation of the N.U.S.S.R. (New Union of Socialist Soviet Republics) the New Soviet government realized that it needed a better missile for its air force. Thus the Sidewinder IIa AAM was born. The early Sidewinder II's were fraught with design problems. The imaging IR seeker lacked sensitivity, and refused to track targets at the outer limits of the missile's range. The thrust vectoring system was slow, resulting in the missile often overshooting agile targets.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, both problems were eventually ironed out, with great improvements eventually made to the maneuvering and imaging systems. The result was the Sidewinder III, one of the most reliable missiles ever made. Later, the N.U.S.S.R. provided the same Carlos Carroll-Teal with a number of the new missiles for a reasonable price to reward his previous assistance to the revolution.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Upon return to the U.S., Carroll-Teal promptly set up a small factory, purportedly for the production of cars. Wishing to get into the legitimate arms business, he also formed a company; the Buffalo Group. This company expanded until it became the main supplier for the entire U.S. military. Recently, BG has released the Sidewinder III on the global market.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unlike its predecessor, the Sidewinder III contains a single-burn engine using a fuel core of hydrogen stored in carbon nanotubes for added stability. This engine is capable of speeds in excess of Mach 7. For additional maneuverability, the Sidewinder III sports twelve extendable fins which can be adjusted during flight by the missile's on-board guidance system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The cobalt-lithium warhead is large enough to down even large aircraft such as cargo and passenger jets. The warhead can be set for an impact or proximity fuse for maximum versatility.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The AIM-213 Titan Heavy Missile was initially designed to engage targets such as airborne missile platforms before they have a chance to enter weapons range. Based on the now defunct AIM-54 Phoenix missile design, the Titan proved to be more than capable of taking down enemy fighters before they have a chance to engage. This extended range engagement is why X-Corps has decided to adopt the AIM-213 Titan as one of the two main missile weapon systems.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While the AIM-54 was deemed one of the more successful long range air to air missile designs, it rarely saw action and was phased out as the need for such weapons had seized with the end of the cold war. The AIM-54 Phoenix was then taken out of active service in 2003. However, with the advent of stealth fighters in the 21st century, new radar and detection technology was developed to counter stealth. This lead to the development of high powered Laser Radars, also know as Ladars, that could detect and identify targets with high precision and resolution at unprecedented ranges. As such, modern fighters frequently have both radar and ladar systems incorporated into the design. The resolution of the ladar system allowed for positive identification and target confirmation at ranges that made long distance engagement possible, thus significantly reducing the risk of accidentally engaging friendly or civilian targets. Also, as propulsion technology improved the speeds at which aircraft travel, the ability to engage distant targets became increasingly important as there now was now less time for defensive aircraft to engage targets traveling through their airspace.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>These factors lead to the revival of the long range air to air intercept engagement concept, and the AIM-54 Phoenix was used as the basis of the AIM-213 design. Equipped with radar, ladar and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), the Titan is capable of independently seeking and destroying a target once lock is achieved. However, if target lock is lost, the Titan is capable of coordinating with the detection system of the launch platform or other nearby friendly detection system via a data-link to improve chances of regaining lock. Due to the size of the Titan, a series of vernier thrusters was built into the missile to improve it's ability to hit agile targets. These features, combined with it's unmatched range and large warhead, results in a missile that uniquely suits the requirements of X-Corps.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, all these features come at a price, the Titan is large and heavy for a missile. Only three of this massive missiles can be carried at a hardpoint, leading to reduced endurance in extended firefights. Once the fighter is out of Titan missiles, it will be forced to either fallback on weapons with shorter ranges or disengaged entirely from the fight. Also, much of the technology behind the Titan missile comes at high costs, resulting in one of the most expensive weapons in our arsenal.</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>Nevertheless, the AIM-213 Titan missile is our best chance of engaging UFOs with minimum risk to our fighters. This is an extremely important issue as we believe that UFO weapon systems are capable of inflicting heavy damage on our crafts if we allow them into engagement range.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>In the early years of the 21st century, the first Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) saw military use. These early models had few, if any weapons and completely lacked autonomy software, instead being directly controlled by a “pilot” in a remote controlling center. The viciousness of the severe conflicts in these days combined with advancements in composites and political fallout from human losses pushed the military ROV into the forefront of both development and deployment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The peak of current ROV technology is the Modular Tank Chassis (MTC), built of carbon-reinforced, high-impact plastic for lightness, giving it unmatched agility and impressive durability. Twin composite treads are laced with carbon-filaments for strength, and, combined with the MTC's liquid-magnetic suspension, allow high travel speeds in virtually any terrain.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Powered by state of the art hydrogen fuel cells, it can sustain field speeds in excess of 45 km/h for 24 hours. To increase the safety of ground personnel, the hydrogen is stored within an explosion-proof nanotube containment block which is directly connected to the oxidation chamber, placed inside the same Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFP) housing. Armored with fifteen layers of ceramic composite mesh, the MTC is well protected against attack with standard ammunition. In addition, redundancy in vital systems allows safe, continued function at near-peak capacities even after sustaining critical damage.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although fully autonomous combat support vehicles are still beyond current technology, the MTC's software enables it to function without constant input from its operator. Following our policy to ensure the agent's full concentration on the battlefield situation, the MTCs are maneuvered by our pilots using a highly sophisticated control console from within the drop ship. Featuring a virtual reality device connected to the MTCs sensor net it gives the pilot an extended range of view allowing an efficient support of the ground troops in every situation. Basic command macros were implemented enabling a single operator to have safe and effective control over several MTCs simultaneously. Commands are sent virtually instantaneously, and interpreted and executed in real time. X-Corps Technicians developed special algorithms that include rudimentary recognition of non-human life forms and advanced terrain filters altering the custom MTC autonomy software package. Since the original MTC design is from the year 2009, X-Corps specifications demanded so many major modifications and upgrades to the original blueprints that we decided to share the modified plans with the original manufacturer who now is able to produce these specialized MTCs very fast to meet needs as they arise. The manufacturing company agreed to an eight year exclusive deal with X-Corps. The internal name for this weapon system is X-Corps Assault Platform (XCAP).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The single hardpoint of our XCAP can accommodate a variety of modular turrets, from conventional weapon systems to custom designed battlefield support equipment, allowing a battle specific armament for outstanding battlefield performance, though unfortunately a fast re-equipment is not possible due to the complex modifications of the XCAPs mechatronics the different weapon types demand.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The MTC T-01C model (in X-Corps referred as "XCAP, Cannon"), is equipped with the first modular weapon system that was available for the MTC, a 30mm cannon turret. Sleek, efficient, and deadly, it is a marvel of modern military technology. With space for thirty depleted-uranium APDS shells, the XCAP Cannon is able to lay down a rapid covering fire, or strike a single target with pinpoint accuracy. While the early pattern recognition systems in the target acquisition software had minor problems with threat determination, the state of the art implementation of Asimov heuristic algorithms in the optical sensor net by X-Corps Technicians has increased its ability to differentiate between an enemy and a friendly unit to safe levels.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Since in the X-Corps this system is only used for immediate "reflex" reactions an unintended harming of own troops is excluded. To even increase the safety, every X-Corps Soldier is scanned by the XCAPs sensors prior to the battle, thus protecting the Soldier from friendly fire unless the piloting officer manually overrides this protection. In addition, this procedure allows better Alien life form recognition in evacuated areas.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>An obvious addition to the X-Corps Assault Platforms (XCAP) complement of weapons was the adaptation of a portable rocket launcher. With the destructive capabilities of eight High-Explosive Rockets added to the speed and maneuverability of the XCAP, the new model is a valuable asset on the battlefield. Based on the Cannon XCAPs sensor equipment, which was reprogrammed to perform a limited missile guidance setting a precise launching vector, the MTC T-02M also known as Rocket XCAP is capable of firing its high explosive STS Rockets with high accuracy in a 45 degree operation angle without moving the base. The rockets large blast radius makes it deadly to enemy ground troops positioned in loose groups even when not hitting the target with full precision, and is a serious threat to other armored vehicles as well. The automatic reload mechanism permits a fully remote controlled operation leaving the troops with much more than just a mobile heavy weapon system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although the parabolic rocket jet deflector allows the Rocket XCAP to retain launch capability in tight quarters, it is not recommended for in-building use since the danger of casualties from the rockets' explosions should not be underestimated. The dispersal of the exhaust blast is so effective that soldiers standing behind or in the vicinity of the launching rocket remain unharmed. When fighting in open terrain this weapon system has all arguments on its side.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Although minor changes in the XCAPs design had to be made, this combination of proven and new technologies equips our troopers with a mobile weapon of both, great reliability and enormous power. While limitations on size and weight of the XCAPs power supply resulted in a considerably reduced emitter strength compared to the original aircraft mounted version, we could still remove the additional focusing diamond lenses reducing the weight of the weapon itself without loosing the benefit of its high accuracy, leaving us with a weapon still outperforming any hand-held Laser weapon.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>After understanding the principles of the Gravity Distortion Launcher, it appeared only logical to develop an XCAP-mounted version of this formidable but bulky weapon. Unfortunately, it wasn't as easy as just welding a GDD to an XCAP. The original GDL is heavily dependent on the human operator for programming of waypoints, which is something definitely not possible in an XCAP. We had to re-structure the weapon's interface to allow a sophisticated targeting routine to take over the function, not only having to identify the target but also an unobstructed airspace for the Gravity Distortion Drones to fly through. The primary area mapping is uploaded into the flight path processor from the landing ship's external sensor data acquired during landing, and is constantly updated to adjust to area changes during battle. For this, it not only features advanced sensors but also interprets input from helmet-camera video links and even spoken transmissions containing environment information. Target designation is done by X-Corps operatives via a simple set of voice commands, while moving into firing position and setting of waypoints are done autonomously. For added security, the flight path chosen is not necessarily the shortest, but usually the most secure, sometimes resulting in seemingly unnecessary detours, to prevent injury of friendly or neutral units. X-Corps units operating with a GDL-equipped XCAP should however be aware that all safety measures may be overriden by simple voice commands.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The GDL Turret is the apex of XCAP weapon design. An amalgamation of the most advanced human technology, and the most devastating of alien weapons, the GDL Turret is capable of accurately finding a target and destroying it along with its surroundings.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The ammunition capacity of the GDL Turret is limited, but still higher than anything a single soldier could carry. The cumulative destruction available with it will in most situations be enough to turn the battle. Whether for surgical strikes or area saturation bombing, an XCAP equipped with a GDL Turret is a valuable addition to any XCorps team.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Research into aircraft plasma weapon design and Alien aircraft has produced an interesting byproduct - the Plasma XCAP-AG. The weapon itself is on par with the most powerful of handheld plasma weapons, but is more Xenium-efficient and requires no separately manufactured clips. With the added maneuverability and durability of a XCAP-AG chassis, it is a valuable addition to the X-Corps arsenal.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The weapon adapted for the XCAP-AG chassis is a research prototype created during the development of the Plasma Cannon. The Plasma Cannon was based upon research on handheld weapons, and several design strategies were implemented along the way. When the AG chassis came to the attention of the research team, the specifications for weapon size and weight matched almost exactly with the third prototype developed. This intermediate model, already too bulky for handheld use and not yet powerful enough to penetrate alien craft hulls, is much more Xenium efficient than its alien predecessors. With just a few mounting modifications, and the addition of the clipless Xenium processing system, it has been appproved for XCAP-AG operation.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>After analyzing the Aliens anti-gravity technology we could recover from downed Alien crafts, it was possible to create our own design of a Xenium Reactor in the Xenium Reactor research. This reactor was completely redesigned to minimize needed space and Xenium usage. The result of this project was a lightweight Xenium reactor, unable to lift a ship, but optimal for a hovering battle support unit and frugal in Xenium consumption.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Since only a relatively small gravitational effect is required, we were able to use Xenium as a catalyst, so it is not depleted while usage of the tank. The disadvantage of this technology is obvious: Since the creation of a “perpetuum mobile” - a device which doesn’t need energy and is still moving all the time - is impossible due to the first thermodynamic rule, the “X-Coprs Assault Platform - Anti Gravitational” (XCAP-AG) needs additional energy, because if the Xenium itself is used as a catalyst only and thus not depleted, it cannot produce energy, so that we can only use it to transform electric energy into gravitational waves. After several tests, we decided to use the same fuel cell/hydrogen nanotube containment block unit already known from the standard XCAP. The power output of two of these cells is used to power the on-board electronics and mechatronics as well as the Xenium reactor, explaining the relatively slender output of this reactor type since it can only transform the limited electrical energy supplied by the fuel cells into gravitational waves .</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The power of the hydrogen cells is used to trigger a newly researched aspect of the Xenium crystals. While we knew before that Xenium is folded and materialized spacetime, we now discovered that, although not used like that by the Aliens, it is possible to optimize the unfolding process up to this extent, that the Xenium is used up about 1000 times slower than with normal technique. We suspect a sort of refolding, but cannot prove this thesis.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Using a pair of superconducting coils powered by a specially designed combined DC/AC converter/adaptor to produce an high frequency AC output, we were able to produce an oscillating magnetic field that almost “conserved” the Xenium while it was bombarded with coherent photons and baryonic matter emitting a strong anti-gravitational field.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The downsides to this technique however are that instead of delivering power through its magnetic field, energy is needed to preserve the Xenium as well as a significantly reduced anti-gravitational output, thus allowing only relatively small objects to be lifted.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Since the redesign of the reactor involves significant changes to the original Alien design it took us some effort to migrate the safety measures implemented in the Alien reactor core. But now even a direct hit will not lead to uncontrolled destruction.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Since the internal systems of an XCAP are, when exposed to massive g effects, much less fragile than humanoid lifeforms, and a sufficiently reliable operation is possible without a “hot spare” core disc, the protection field as well as the redundant engine core system of the original Xenium Reactor are obsolete, allowing a much smaller and more lightweight design. After running several tests with this new equipment we achieved to fit it in a newly designed chassis and can assure a safe and reliable usage in field. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The resulting XCAP-AG is capable of limited flight in heights up to 30 meters and reaches a top speed of 50 km/h for about 15 hours. Its autonomous command/control interface is based on newest research into the AI field. An analysis of the semi autonomous UFO control circuits which support the Alien navigators, combined with our own efforts to enhance the XCAPs autonomy software, helped us to develop fast and reliable algorithms for autonomous navigation as well as spotting, tracking and engaging of enemy units. Combined with enhanced sensors nets using video sources, LASER and ultra sound measurement as well as acoustical input and uplinks from the team cameras this new generation XCAP is able to act just like, or even better than a human soldier. To allow simple communication with the ground troops, the XCAP-AG features full speech controlled action and vocal response to human combatants as well as simple data uplink to the soldiers HUDs. To prevent collision of given orders, a voice recognition algorithm was implemented, to allow the in field commanding officer a regulation of order rights.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The hull of the XCAP-AG Chassis is completely constructed of alien composites, thus making it a near to perfect armor - shielding the sensitive electronics even from closely impacting Gravity Distortion Drones and is yet very lightweight. It features a hardpoint to mount custom designed weapons, although the chassis itself needs to be especially altered for different weapon types. Inside the hull enough space was left for additional guidance systems or ammunition and future upgrades of the XCAP-AG concept.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With the XCAP-AG we now can regain aerial superiority in battle zones.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>While plasma-based weaponry has been a staple in science fiction, the obstacles involved in reaction containment and sustainment could only be overcome with the advanced and great technical capabilities of a large facility entirely dedicated to this purpose, and even then only for a short period of time. However, the arrival of the Aliens with their advanced technology and new compounds led us to question our previous conclusions. With the thorough study of a large portable plasma weapon and clip recovered from the battlefield, along with our superficial analysis of the unique Xenium that serves as ammunition, we have uncovered the theory behind the functionality of plasma weapons. We now have the knowledge necessary to develop plasma weaponry of equal to or greater firepower capability than that of the Alien invaders.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>All three types of handheld plasma weaponry used by the Aliens have several similarities. The heart of the plasma weapon consists of a "funnel" of superconductor magnets terminated with magneto dynamic prongs on one end, and a plasma-generation chamber at the other. Plasma generated in the chamber is forced through the magnetic funnel by a brief electromagnetic pulse. As the plasma passes through the funnel, it is compressed into a tight stream of particles. The magnetic prominences on the barrel then focus and accelerate the resultant plasma into tight bursts.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Another integral part of plasma weapon design is its high-efficiency heatsink. Made of a variation of the ceramic compounds found in the Alien Composites, this advanced heat sink exceeds anything we could ever make in heat tolerance. Even though the plasma is never in direct contact with any part of the weapon, considerable heat is transferred by radiation.  Without this heat sink, the weapon itself would melt within seconds, inflicting terrible burns on the user in the process. The heat sink draws the heat generated by the plasma burst away from the barrel to a heat dissipater located along the edges of the magneto dynamic prongs, which also contain and disperse the powerful electromagnetic fields generated when firing the weapon.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>During our research into the invaders' captured weapon, it has been noted that they have two ammunition containers, one containing a simple Deuterium Oxide solution, better known as heavy water. The other, however, contains a unique gel-like compound. Further testing on this unique substance revealed that it is a compound derived from Xenium. When Xenium crystals are exposed to X-ray laser, they fracture into a fine powder. When the resulting powder is combined with uranium, iron and carbon, the resulting mixture has a gel-like consistency.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>What makes this compound useful is that it is viscous enough to be magnetically levitated using the properties of the iron in it, and it is stable enough to be stored for long periods of time. However, when this compound is stimulated with electromagnetic pulses in the presence of heavy water, it starts a high-energy reaction leading to the fusion of deuterium, causing the mixture to convert into plasma. The ability to replicate this Xenium-gel has proven to be vital in the creation of portable Alien plasma weapons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Xenium has an important property that allowed the Aliens to overcome all of the theoretical barriers to plasma weaponry.  Indepth studies of the plasma weapon revealed that the Xenium material not only generates the energy requried to convert the reaction mass into high-energy plasma, but also produces an incredibly strong, very short-range gravity field. The xenium particles gravitate towards the center of the plasma packet, creating a field powerful enough to prevent the expansion of the plasma particles, even with their incredible kinetic energies. This gravity effect lowers the energy requirement of magnetic containment to a reasonable amount.  It is also powerful enough to carry the plasma burst along with the Xenium, which circumvents the problems with electromagnetically accelerating a substance made up of oppositely charged particles.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Test firing revealed that the ratio of xenium to deuterium defines the distance that the plama packet will retain its coherency. A ratio of 1:50 results in distances of approximately 1000 meters before the plasma packet disperses.  </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The damage caused by a plasma hit is fearsome to behold. The energy of the particles is sufficient to disrupt the target - organic or otherwise - at an molecular level, ionizing atoms by knocking off electrons and therefore destroying covalent bonds. The amount of energy present is commonly enough to “dissolve” the first surface struck, leaving behind only ionized atoms where there used to be structured molecules or cells. For humans, the repair of such wounds is similar to treating third-degree burns from mundane causes. However, recent medical advances in adult stem cell, cloning, and growth hormone technologies enable us to perfectly heal these gruesome injuries within a few months. The main side effect of these accelerated growth techniques is the increased risk of cancer during the treatment; patients must be observed around the clock in order to detect aberrant cell growth. Thus, any wounded agent is completely unable to go on missions for the duration of his recovery period.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We have discovered a potential method of plasma generation that might be even more efficient than that of the Alien invaders. We must learn as much as we can before this extraterrestrial menace discovers our location.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The Plasma Pistol is the most compact weapon in the Aliens' arsenal. Even so, it is more powerful than the X-Corps’ standard light rifle in both close quarters and long range combat situations due to its light weight and ease of aiming. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Plasma Pistol’s design consists of four main components: the plasma generation chamber, barrel, magneto-dynamic prongs, and magazine housing. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The plasma generation chamber is easily the most complex part of the weapon; it is thermally isolated from the outside environment, an obvious necessity since even the smallest leakage of plasma would result in severe burns to the user. This thermal isolation is achieved primarily through several vacuum chambers interspersed with a reflective material taken from Alien Composites. The plasma itself is magnetically levitated in the center of the chamber to prevent it from damaging to the weapon itself. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Designed apertures are precisely equipped with valves and heat sinks, ensuring that any escaping heat is properly dissipated away from the user. Judging by the quality of design and manufacture, it would appear that the Aliens have gone to great pains to avoid unnecessary injury to their soldiers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The barrel uses both magnetic and electric fields to guide the plasma out of the chamber and partially collimate the beam. The anterior magneto-dynamic prongs on the front of the weapon are the hallmark of Alien plasma technology; they are used to manipulate the magnetic fields produced by the barrel, ensuring that the plasma blast fired from the weapon stays focused and accurate. Though only two prongs are present in the Plasma Pistol, it is theorized that more prongs would increase the collimation of the beam, increasing both range and accuracy, but would require considerably more power. As the amount of plasma generated by this weapon dissipates after a reasonably short distance, it would appear that it was designed for either short range situations or as a backup weapon.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The magazine housing itself is of a relatively simple design, serving to the same purpose as present conventional weaponry’s magazine housings do. It is designed, however, to load two different substances into the weapon. Preliminary analysis show traces of heavy water and a gel-like substance, which will not be contemplated on this report.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The clip is a relatively simple piece of equipment, but analysis of its contents will require separate research. The clip appears to contain the two different solutions mentioned above.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The maximum rate of fire of the Plasma Pistol is roughly equivalent to that of our Assault Rifle due to the time it takes to generate the plasma and accelerate it. The destructive potential of plasma and the fact that this pistol is capable of sustained fire with such a small generation chamber is a testament to Alien manufacture and design.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The [plasma pistol] clip is a relatively simple piece of technology; from both a mechanical and electrical viewpoint, it is easy to reproduce and use. However, the chemistry contained within is considerably more complicated. Each Alien plasma weapon design fires its own specialized ammunition, and their respective clips rely on separately balanced sets of chemical and physical reactions. The [plasma rifle] clip's contents seem to be optimized for a balance between speed and power.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Within the [plasma pistol] clip are two compartments that hold the reactants. The first compartment contains a gel-like mixture containing highly fractured Xenium, iron, uranium, and trace amounts of several other elements, while the other compartment contains heavy water. It should be noted that these contents are kept highly isolated to minimize the risk to the user.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When the two ingredients are mixed and a high-frequency electromagnetic pulse applied, the Xenium reacts violently in a manner that can be best described as an explosion. The immense amount of released energy initiates a fusion chain reaction; the fusion of deuterium atoms found in heavy water releases even more energy and superheats the mixture, continuing until the reactants are spent. The result, contained by magnetic fields, is plasma - a superheated, ionic, electrically conductive gas. The resulting burst, directed by the weapon, is not the beam of energy that many might imagine, but actually a form of mass heated to extraordinary levels.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Because the contents of the [plasma pistol] clip are optimized for speed rather than power, the [plasma pistol] does not possess the same degree of lethality that its larger cousins do, though it remains particularly dangerous against unarmored targets. However, the limited quantities of reactants required for the [plasma pistol]’s small plasma generation chamber do translate into relatively low manufacturing costs.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Plasma Rifle is the Alien-equivalent of the [light rifle], and it is a staple weapon in their arsenal. Powerful, fast, and accurate, the Plasma Rifle vastly outperforms its Terran counterpart in every category, but at a steep price; its manufacturing process is significantly more time-consuming and more expensive than that of the [light rifle]. Nevertheless, the Plasma Rifle's versatility makes it quite suitable for close quarters, long range, and open-area combat. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Plasma Rifle bears all the hallmarks of plasma technology – anterior magneto-dynamic prongs, lateral feeder tubes, strategically placed high-capacity heat sinks, and the grip-glove favored by Alien physiologies. A handle attached near the front of the weapon allows for increased stability and accuracy. Although the weapon can be fired with one hand, accuracy is significantly reduced when it is used in this manner. The burst mode is capable of firing three deadly shots in rapid succession; the incredible heat from mere glancing shots and possibility of demolecularization from direct hits make the Plasma Rifle a formidable weapon indeed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The three-prong design and longer barrel offer increased accuracy, collimation, and plasma capacity over the smaller pistol designs, and the larger plasma generation chamber allows for more powerful blasts. The Plasma Rifle is suitable for a variety of functions; its light weight allows it to be carried by agents with average to sub-average physical strength, but in spite of this, it remains powerful enough to take down most Aliens creatures with only a few hits. As a close quarters weapon, the Plasma Rifle's enhanced damage is its most significant advantage over its smaller cousins since these weapons seem to have comparable rates of fire. At longer ranges, the weapon performs admirably as well, though it lacks the penetrating power of heavier Alien weapons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The clip for the Plasma Rifle itself is similar to those of other plasma-based weaponry, but analysis of its contents will require separate research. The clip appears to contain two different solutions, and preliminary analysis suggests the presence of Xenium in one compartment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With the advent of an X-Corps-manufacturable version of the Plasma Rifle, it is highly recommended that the X-Corps augment its arsenal to take advantage of the superior capabilities of plasma weaponry and relegate its less advanced weaponry to non-critical missions. However, due of our current inability to manufacture Xenium-122, plasma-based weaponry should not be used recklessly, and it would be wise to stock several non-Xenium intensive weapons for emergencies.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The [heavy plasma rifle] is one of the most powerful weapons in the Aliens’ arsenal. Combining accuracy and firepower in a surprisingly light-weight shell, this weapon is a favored choice by the Aliens - for good reason.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The weapon's fearful appearance daunts even the bravest of troopers, particularly those who have seen what it is capable of. The huge barrel caliber, prominent magneto-dynamic prongs, and intimidating overall size only hint at its destructive power. And beneath the deadly-looking exterior lies circuitry so advanced that its basic mechanics are not yet understood.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The plasma generation chamber is a work of art. After the two fluids contained within separate compartments of the ammunition clip are pumped into the chamber, the resulting mixture is magnetically levitated into the center. An applied electromagnetic pulse produces a tremendous explosion that transforms the raw ammunition into plasma. The chamber harnesses a small fraction of the resulting energy to safely contain the plasma using electromagnetic fields assisted by a little-understood gravitic property of Xenium. The plasma is then accelerated out of the barrel using electromagnetic fields. This process can be completed with sufficient speed to allow three-shot bursts.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Four magneto-dynamic prongs are used to collimate, control, and further accelerate the plasma. By the time the plasma leaves the barrel, it has a velocity comparable to most projectile weapons. It is the opinion of several X-corps engineers that a fifth prong should have been added for increased accuracy, as the current four are barely able to contain the beam. However, initial investigations into this change have resulted in catastrophic failures, ranging from simple inoperability to total plasma destabilization. It becomes quite apparent that the circuitry surrounding the prongs is not yet fully understood.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The weapon is large enough to require two grip-gloves, and it is so bulky that it cannot be fired from the shoulder like traditional weapons. Instead, it is fired from the hip. Because hip-fired weapons generally are significantly less accurate than their shoulder-fired counterparts, we were at a loss at how to explain the accuracy Alien soldiers demonstrated with this weapon on the field. Indeed, initial firing tests showed that the [heavy plasma rifle] had consistently higher accuracy than comparable human weaponry. Investigation into this phenomenon showed that the distal third of the plasma funnel is lined with impulse-adjusting superconducting electromagnets linked to complex circuitry that has no observable input. The circuitry is comprised of a conducting variant of Alien Composites, formed without a substrate. This component appears to adjust the direction of the fired plasma more precisely than simple point-and-fire methods. Test subjects have been heard to refer to the [heavy plasma rifle] as a '"smart weapon that knows where to shoot," and if it were not so unbelievable of an idea, that would appear to be precisely what is occurring. Though clearly impossible, it acts very much as if it is reading the wielder's mind. What is certain is that this weapon does not require or benefit from the normal augmentations to heavy weaponry such as HUD-integrated laser targeting. Though the complex circuitry of the heavy plasma rifle has been successfully replicated, we do not fully understand its operation and have been unable to integrate it into other weapons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The clip for the [heavy plasma rifle] itself is similar to those of other plasma-based weaponry, but analysis of its contents will require separate research. The clip appears to contain two different solutions, and preliminary analysis suggests the presence of Xenium in one compartment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"Lou, the physics lead, has been holed up in his corner muttering to himself ever since our soldiers first reported that the Aliens were using plasma weapons...something about plasma weapons being theoretically impossible. I guess no one ever told the Aliens that. We just bring him food, ignore the muttering, and concentrate on doing our job. Now that we've built the thing, I wonder why he gets paid more than I do..."</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>A key element of the alien arsenal is the Gravity Distortion Launcher (GDL), a highly destructive variant of gravity propulsion systems engineered into a unique and devastating tactical device. The GDL fires an agile, self-propelled drone carrying a warhead using Xenium as the source of power for propulsion as well as detonation. It is one of the most destructive weapons available to alien footsoldiers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Xenium "explosion" is actually a very complex quantum-physical reaction which we do not yet understand fully. The effect, though, is rather simple and comparable to "conventional" explosives in all but damage-to-payload ratio. The explosion is several times stronger and at the same time very localized, probably a side-effect of the gravity-influencing effects of Xenium.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The sheer destructive force of this technology is staggering, but the GDL has one more trick up its sleeve: onboard tactical mapping systems. Each drone can be programmed by navigation devices within the launcher, effectively allowing the fired rounds freeform velocity control. Before being launched, the user can enter a variety of "waypoints". Adjusting its course in midair, the drone can alter its trajectory to follow the preset waypoints in the same manner UFOs do, navigating even the tightest turns with relative ease and respectable precision. The result is a deadly, fearsome weapon capable of eliminating distant targets with a high degree of accuracy combined with an area effect larger than even that of our Satchel Charges.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Launcher itself is a highly complicated system which apparently does not program the drone electronically, but instead alters a gravity field created by the drone in such a way that the drone passively follows the preset course after its launch. At the same time, it uses part of the Drone's energy to create a containment field, shielding the user. We do not fully understand the principles behind this technology, but we are able to reproduce it, and we believe that we will be able to make adjustments allowing the application of this technology on a larger scale.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Thanks to an intuitive interface, this weapon can be easily used by any soldier capable of carrying its immense weight. Long-range military applications of the technology outside of X-Corps are not recommended, due to its awesome destructive potential. Once field applications are initialized, it is not recommended to be used in highly populated, or otherwise urban areas, as well.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Gravity Distortion Drone is an amazing piece of technology that may not look overly complicated, but upon closer examination turns out to be almost as complicated as an alien UFO. Although it can only be fired using the Gravity Distortion Launcher, it is a self-propelled drone. The internal systems use Xenium as the source of power for propulsion as well as detonation.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Loaded into the sealed chamber, the Gravity Distortion Drone (GDD) is activated before being launched. The propulsion system creates a self-contained gravity field around the drone, which is in turn altered by the systems of the Launcher. The Launcher programs the projectile's propulsion field with vectors calculated from the pre-selected waypoints and then releases it. From the data we have been able to gather, it appears that the Launcher's systems fold the Drone's gravity field onto itself several times, creating layers of inward-directed spatial distortion effects. The Drone is directly influenced only by the innermost field at any given time, "falling" into the direction it dictates until the field dissipates. The next field then comes into effect, and the Drone "falls" in a new direction - at a speed of several hundred meters per second. When the Drone hits an object with large enough force, the engine also supplies the power for the detonation. The propulsion system's power is enough to allow the projectile to travel several hundred meters without a noticeable drop in destructive force.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While we do not know exactly what happens in the detonation, we have gained some insight from reports and recordings of battlefield as well as in-depth analysis of objects recovered from within the blast radius of Gravity Drone explosions. We theorize that upon impact, the gravity-creating reaction is de-stabilized, causing a chaotic force field that instantaneously affects an entire area around the point of origin. This effect is very disruptive on biological and inert material. In addition to that, there is a plasma explosion that probably occurs when part of the remaining Xenium disintegrates uncontrolledly, atomizing the Drone itself.</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>The combined destructive force is quite terrifying. It appears the aliens themselves share a kind of universal apprehensiveness about using the device too freely, and avoid using it anywhere within minimal safe distance. While the observed blast radius has never exceeded a certain size, the weapon should be used with great care, nonetheless, as we don't know if the unleashed energies are capable of triggering quantum chain reactions on a large scale. Nothing the research division tested was completely able to resist the shockwave or contain the disruptive force effect.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Weapons/Laser Principles</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Several decades of new discoveries in science, technology, and engineering have provided the tools for the creation of High-Energy Lasers (HELs), a significant contribution toward the improvement of our security. Due to the difficulties involved in generating enough light intensity with a portable device, lasers that do more than blinding the target have been just a science-fiction dream until now.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Current LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) technology works by passing a strong electrical current through stacked laser diodes. The laser crystal is housed in a tube filled with a highly transparent and heat conductive liquid, and is capped with a fully reflecting mirror on one end and a partial mirror on the other.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>At the atomic level, the difference of potential in the crystal helps electrons to get promoted to higher energy levels, in a metastable state, but return gradually to their initial energy, the excess being released as photons. Those photons that do not have their direction perpendicular to the mirrors are quickly lost as heat, but those that do, rebound from one mirror to the other allowing more and more metastable atoms to lose their energy as photons having the same direction with the incident photons. The result is an exponential growth in the number of photons of the same wavelength, phase and direction. Once the light intensity reaches a threshold, it can pass through the partially mirrored end in a highly focused beam. Though such a beam should theoretically have an infinite range, water vapor and other particles in the air, such as dust, smoke, and smog, reduce the effective range of any laser-based weapon. Each particle in the path of the beam absorbs a small fraction of its energy, essentially leeching away the carefully focused power of the laser. Until now, laser designs lacked the power to overcome this phenomenon.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>New research has uncovered a way to manufacture laser crystals that are significantly more powerful, efficient, and durable than previous ruby- or carbon dioxide-based devices. This technique of growing synthetic diamond laser core crystals with alternating layers of positive (beryllium and boron) and negative (nitrogen and oxygen) dopants allows us to greatly exceed the size of the crystals used previously for laser diodes and increase the laser output tremendously.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Combined with recent advances in the material science that allowed the development of power capacitors based on high temperature superconductors, our newest laser prototypes can store more than enough energy to last through a lengthy engagement. These capacitors are connected sequentially, gradually transferring electricity to the laser core and greatly improving the safety of the user by preventing accidental discharges.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Lasers deliver the bulk of their energy to a relatively small spot, proportional with the size of the laser crystal, about one centimeter in diameter. In the past, the typical melt-through time for a thick metallic object was about 10 seconds; however, the improved capacitors dump the stored energy in less than a fraction of second, resulting in a laser beam capable of burning a hole through a 10-centimeter thick steel plate within milliseconds.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The fact that laser weapons have almost no moving parts results in a weapon that is not only easier to maintain, but also more reliable than conventional weapons. The loss of accuracy due to the time delay required by the electricity transfer through capacitors is partially compensated by the lack of recoil. Improving the accuracy of laser weapons is just a matter of perfecting the technology involved in this rate of transfer.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is extremely important to realize the extent of this technology within the X-Corps. Appropriately developed and applied, high-energy laser systems can become an important contributor to the defense of our world. Complete and successful development of directed energy weapons will require extensive testing, both in the laboratory and in the field to mature all the technologies involved, and to apply the growing capabilities in the most efficient way.</paragraph>

He pointed at the pile of scrap metal he'd been using as a table for the wine, and he said this new diamond laser could go through it like butter. We were so excited; we had a working model constructed by the end of the day."</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The XLW-01 Laser Pistol is the first of X-Corps' newly developed portable laser weaponry. Despite the fact that heavier conventional weaponry offers both greater accuracy and damage capacity than the laser pistol, the XLW-01 should not be discounted as a sidearm. Field tests indicate that the Laser Pistol's primary advantages over our current standard firearm are its extremely fast auto-fire speed, its increased damage potential, and its almost unlimited firing capacity. Unlike conventional pistols, which require soldiers to keep track of their remaining ammunition, this weapon can last the duration of a sustained firefight on a single charge. Preliminary field trials demonstrate the high combat effectiveness of the Laser Pistol, and we recommend that standard issue handguns be replaced by it.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Laser Pistol can be broken down into four main components: the primary capacitor, located in the handle; the laser core, located in the anterior half of the barrel; the firing mechanism, located behind the core and includes the trigger and secondary capacitor; and the cooling system, encasing both the secondary capacitor and the laser core and extending into the heat exhanger along the underside of the barrel.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Early rate of fire issues were solved by the addition of the secondary capacitor. This addition enhances the safety of the Laser Pistol, buffering the user in case of accidental discharge of the primary capacitor, which acts as the magazine-equivalent for the XLW-01, holding the full power charge. The secondary capacitor functions similarly to the chamber of a mundane pistol, only charging when the weapon is about to be fired. This secondary charging occurs when the shooter's finger rests on the trigger. Full compression of the trigger is still required to activate the pistol, and the secondary charge will dissipate a short while after the finger is removed from the trigger.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Despite being able to achieve a maximum rate of fire nearly twice that of a standard Pistol, the Laser Pistol cannot sustain this a rate of fire indefinitely due to inadequate heat dissipation of the core. Tests have shown that extreme temperatures can result in severe degradation of core material, reducing both the effectiveness and the life span of the laser core by as much as eighty percent, and in some cases, causing the catastrophic failure of the primary capacitor. As a result, the XLW-01 has been limited to three shots in this rapid fire mode, after which an automatic safety mechanism will prevent further firing until the laser core has sufficiently cooled.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Agents MUST be warned that attempts to override the three shot limitation or bypass the secondary capacitor are likely to result in severe injury or even death.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"We'd been sweeping through a disheveled group of Greys from a downed Recon UFO for a minute or two. We were down to the last few bugs; we had them pinpointed and were closing fast. After a brief firefight, there was only one left, firing out of some bushes. We hadn't taken any casualties yet, so I was feeling pretty good. I let the soldiers exchange fire with the last Alien, figuring we had better cover and could outlast it. Unfortunately, one of my soldiers, Ensign Sam "Grizzly" Mugalla, got tired of being shot at, and, you know, had a little shell shock going. He bolted straight at the target with a nice, steady grip on the trigger of his Laser Pistol, something R&amp;D had just cooked up. Unfortunately, those things overload pretty easily, especially when you strip the safety catch.</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>He scared that little bug-eyed freak to death, and then shot it some more just for good measure. I kept calling him back to formation, but I figured he'd shoot until he was good and ready to come back. Then the pistol overloaded right in his hand. That put him in the medical bay for a few weeks. Now they have a tamper-proof, fully-integrated safety mechanism. They call it the Grizzly Circuit."</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The Laser Rifle, nicknamed as the "Torch", is a revolutionary weapon capable of dealing with a majority of known Alien species with greater effectiveness than our conventional weaponry. It features the firepower to pierce tough Alien hide and a significantly higher ammunition capacity than standard firearms.  </paragraph>
        <paragraph>"Your new "Torch" Laser Rifle is a powerful weapon, and like a well-bred pet, it requires very little attention to keep it out of trouble. All you have to do is wipe the weapon’s external heat sinks before use; the rest of the rifle is sealed airtight and requires no maintenance. What could be simpler? Keep your "Torch" happy and it will keep you alive!" -"The Care and Feeding of Energy Weapons", excerpt from the X-Corps Training Manual.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The "Torch" is the second generation of laser weaponry and a definite step up from the earlier pistol design. Its main advantages over the laser pistol are vastly increased damage, accuracy and maximum effective range. It is our first genuinely adequate tool for engaging Aliens in prolonged medium-range ground combat situations.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The laser core runs along the length of the rifle's barrel. The increased barrel length has allowed us to fit in a larger semiconductive diamond core, consequently multiplying the laser’s intensity. When the Laser Rifle's trigger is pressed, a bank of high density capacitors discharge an electrical impulse within the laser core, where the energy is transformed into photons, amplified virtually instantaneously, and released in short and intense laser pulses. As soon as the Laser Rifle fires, its banks of capacitors begin recharging and the laser core disperses the heat generated, resulting in a moderately fast, sustainable rate of fire.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to its lack of moving parts, the Laser Rifle requires little field maintenance. In fact, if the weapon’s case remains sealed, the weapon's estimated lifespan is 2 years of sustained use before needing a laser core replacement. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Overall, the Laser Rifle has proven itself admirably, and should be issued as a replacement to our standard rifles despite its greater cost. Its increased damage and range may allow our troops to gain the edge with the Aliens. </paragraph>

        <paragraph>"When I saw this baby in action, I knew I had to get one. Our old rifles could barely penetrate even the thin hides of the little bug-eye Aliens; this 'Laser' rifle cuts through just about anything instantly. When I first tested this weapon, we set up an Alien dummy, you know, one of the grey ones. I fired a single shot, and it burned a hole clean through the dummy and half-way though the reinforced wall behind it.  I can’t wait to zap a Grey with it!" -Cpl. Alex Dupont</paragraph>

        <paragraph>XLW-07 “BROILER” [HEAVY LASER]</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Weapons/[Heavy Laser]</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Broiler is an basically an improved [LASER RIFLE], featuring both better damage and accuracy at the expense of rate of fire. This [HEAVY LASER]’s damage potential is great enough to punch even through heavy Alien armor, making it vital in combating the more resilient strains of Alien creatures. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>“Commander Schultsky told me and my research team to create a larger and more powerful version of the [LASER RIFLE] for our operatives to use. The word from the front was not good: our soldiers were getting pasted. In an attempt to tip the scales in our favor; we tried making a heavier model, but the standard rifle frame simply did not have enough space. It was Jessica’s idea to use a frame salvaged from a [HEAVY CANNON]. From there we just crammed the components in. A month later we unveiled the Broiler[HEAVY LASER]. That same day I proposed to Jessica, and she accepted.”  -Head physicist George Schlieffen. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Broiler is currently the most advanced terrestrial personal weapon available. Its damage capability and range have been significantly increased from the earlier rifle and pistol designs. In an evolutionary move, X-Corps designers have moved away from a hand-held rifle concept and embraced a larger two hand frame similar to the [HEAVY] and [AUTOCANNON]s currently in use. The larger frame allows for additional components to increase the weapon’s functionality. The Starfire consists of seven distinct components: laser core, firing mechanism, primary capacitor, secondary capacitor (safety circuit), tertiary capacitor, amplifier, and targeting computer system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The oversized laser core within the weapon allows for larger, more powerful streams of synchronized light energy to be released every firing cycle.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The firing mechanism on the Broiler differs significantly from those of previous laser weapons. Due to weight and balance issues, the rear grip of the weapon contains the twist-trigger. By depressing a recessed safety catch and twisting the grip, the weapon can be discharged.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The primary capacitor stores the energy used to excite the lasing material within the core and merges the product (a HEL or High-Energy Laser) into a coherent beam. Once the trigger grip’s safety is depressed, the weapon begins charging, and within a second, it will have gathered enough energy to fire. The XLW-07’s primary capacitor is larger and more robust than the earlier laser designs, significantly decreasing the chances of weapon malfunction.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The secondary capacitor is situated below the primary grip and grounds the user from premature discharges. It also regulates the primary capacitor, preventing too great of a charge from building up.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The tertiary capacitor can, in the event of a failure of the primary capacitor, store a limited amount of laser energy. While the weapon can still fire at reduced strength, it will quickly need to be recharged, unlike previous weapon designs where if the primary capacitor failed, the weapon was out of commission.  Although redundant, it was deemed important enough to include in this advanced design. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Broiler’s larger frame allows a larger and more advanced black carbon prism to be mounted as an amplifier. When the laser beam is directed through the prism, the beam’s energy is magnified two-fold, doubling the [HEAVY LASER]’s striking power and greatly increasing its range.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The integrated targeting computer is a high-grade target acquisition system which emits a low-powered targeting laser when the safety is released. This targeting laser is aligned with the main laser beam and acts as a sight. The soldier’s HUD is sensitive to the targeting laser’s wavelength, allowing the soldier to determine when the weapon is on target with point-and-click accuracy.</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>“I was one of the first ones to field test the new [HEAVY LASER], and I must say it was love at first shot. The damn thing nearly fires itself! The only thing I had to do was center the Grey in my HUD, twist the handle, and wham! One less bug polluting the universe! It’s powerful too: it actually burned through the bug and went on to burn a foot-wide hole through a boulder! I hope I never have to use a normal gun again!” -Sgt. Alex Dupont </paragraph>

        <paragraph>Since the sixteenth century, soldiers have been carrying pistols in combat, mostly as a backup to their primary weapon. Pistols by their very nature are designed to be lightweight and versatile weapons used in close quarters or emergencies.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The basic setup of the T-37 Heavy Pistol is very classical: An ergonomically molded grip contains the ammunition clip while the main casing contains a precision crafted nickel-steel barrel. The components have been carefully balanced to create maximum stability while firing.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The details, however, show the advanced technology of this weapon. The ammunition consists of caseless rounds, for decreased weight and almost no danger of jamming the loading mechanism. The propellant is molded directly onto the projectile and triggered by an electric discharge, eliminating the need for a metal casing and a firing cap. The chamber of the gun has been reinforced and fitted with airtight seals to direct the force of the explosion forward, eliminating the need for a metal case. This reduction in cartridge mass makes it possible to increase the amount of propellant as well as the bullet mass, amplifying the damage delivered.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The counterweight slide features a magnetic shock buffering system instead of the standard metal spring. Strong lanthanide-based permanent magnets have been found to buffer the kinetic energy more effectively than mechanical systems, softening recoil as well as eliminating the risk of mechanical failure in heavy-use situations.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>All in all, the T-37 is the newest and finest in small sidearms. Although many veterans have expressed concerns about using a weapon that has not been "tested" in "at least one World War", it has been chosen for its superior firepower, as well as the very promising caseless ammunition system, particularly because of the low danger of jamming. We believe that our soldiers will need these properties in dealing with the threat at hand.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Since the creation of gunpowder, the standard military service weapon has traditionally been a rifle. When it became obvious that a multi-national task force had to be created, a fundamental problem soon arose: Integration. Almost every nation’s armed forces used a different weapon with its own ammunition type, which would quickly lead to logistical problems out in the field. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Thus X-Corps Command approached several arms manufacturers through unofficial government channels, offering a joint contract for the designing and manufacturing of a new advanced standard-issue rifle.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although the fear of intellectual property theft generated some reluctance, the immediate Alien threat and the offer of an initial large, undisclosed sum of money overcame their reservations. In exchange, they would create a revolutionary rifle to which they would collectively retain the relevant patents and copyrights, but limit their sales exclusively to the X-Corps for the duration of the Alien menace. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Assault Rifle is the result of their efforts. It is powerful, accurate and built for extreme conditions. In addition to these strong points,  it is shorter and lighter than most other rifles, making it extremely handy in tight situations. Two firing modes are implemented; a thumb-activated selector switch allows the soldier to change firing modes from single shot to three-round burst. Fully automatic firing, although technically possible, was omitted for ammunition conservation reasons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Assault Rifle uses a high-kinetic propellant caseless ammunition system very similar to the [X-Corps PISTOL]. The increased propellant mass compared to conventional ammunition is capable of accelerating the bullets to very high speeds, while at the same time leaving no spent cartridges at the scene of battle. Steel-tipped bullets are accountable for good armor-piercing capabilities, and a lead body ensures a high stopping power.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The increased recoil associated with high muzzle velocities is partly compensated via a pneumatic buffering system as well as a field-moldable shoulder piece made from memory plastics which guarantees a large rifle-shoulder contact area, minimizing recoil sores.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Another highly sophisticated component of the weapon is its scope, which gives the soldier unparalleled accuracy in single shot mode, possessing a combined 4x optical magnification system, a built-in residual light amplification and a thermal imaging processor. This makes the Assault Rifle an excellent weapon for night missions or when visibility is limited.</paragraph>

      <fluff>
        <paragraph>X-Corps employs the Assault Rifle as standard equipment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>For special purposes, X-Corps tactical analysts recommend the use of specialized weapons, such as explosives for wide-area destruction and large-caliber automatic weaponry for heavily armored opponents. For standard combat situations, however, the Assault Rifle has been unanimously voted "weapon of choice".</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The MM-7 Mark 2 'Heavy Cannon' 20mm multi-purpose cannon  is a result of combining old USSR designs with modern day technology. The designs were acquired during the cold war, by U.S. military intelligence, however the designs were incomplete and had a few terminal flaws that made the MM-7 an unreachable goal until very few years ago.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MM-7 is designed as a curious hybrid of a light granade launcher and a sniper rifle, or perhaps calling the MM-7 a portable artillery weabon would be more appropriate.The MM-7 features semi-automatic fire and the ability to choose the type of ammunition you want to use. Clips can contain up to six High Explosive, Incendiary or Armor Piercing rounds.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Normally weapons using 20mm ammo are mounted on a bipod/tripod or a vehicle, this is however not the case with MM-7. The MM-7 uses a metallic spring and a polymeric nanomuscle or "memory plastic" composite structure for dampening the recoil. This system is highly effective, but the recoil is still powerful enough to cause a strong jolt. The "memory plastic" used in the recoil dampening functions by assuming its original form after compression when subjected to a specified frequency of electricity.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The targeting system on the MM-7 is designed to dramatically increase the level of enviormental awareness of the operatives. The targeting system's main function is to show to the operative what kind of effect to the bullet surrounding enviorment has. </paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>First appearing as part of several modular weapon concepts at the beginning of the 21st century, the design and prototypes of the Repeater Cannon were then shelved due to weight and size considerations. When technology finally caught up with the designer's ambition, several prototypes were quickly built, tested and introduced into combat through numerous small classified engagements and found to be eminently suitable for an anti-extraterrestrial role in X-Corps.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The AR-110 Repeater Cannon is an automatic, man-portable assault/support weapon designed for maximum firepower and portability. Each magazine holds 14 rounds of 20mm ammunition to minimize weight and maximize the amount of time the weapon may function in combat without reload. The weapon itself is constructed using a high density polymer, intended to keep manufacturing costs as low as possible and to reduce weight at the same time.

Only the strongest and most qualified heavy weapons specialists should use this weapon.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The AR-110 has 3 different types of ammunition, Armor Piercing (AP), High Explosive (HE), and Incendiary (IC). The AP rounds are standard ammunition and are to be used in most combat situations. The HE rounds are of course explosive and unsuitable for close quarters or engagement of nearby enemies, but against groups of enemies and cover, the HE rounds are immensely effective. IC rounds are essentially a White Phosphorus (WP) grenade. Upon detonation, a cloud of noxious fumes and hundreds of WP shards are is (the cloud) sprayed in a 5 meter range, although maximum effective range is 3 meters. The shards of</paragraph>
        <paragraph>WP, upon contact with oxygen, burst into flame, causing a very hot fire, which will burn until all of the WP is gone, or until the oxygen source has disappeared. WP shards on contact with flesh, if allowed to, will burn down to the bone until smothered in flesh and blood. IC rounds also contain an amount of Potassium permangenate, which begins breaking down almost immediately after impact, and travels with the WP shards, providing oxygen for the WP to burn even in the most hostile and inflammable environments.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The Stun Baton is designed with one purpose in mind: to incapacitate an enemy unit; for which it has proven to be truly exceptional. In testing trials, every single animal and Human subject was rendered unconscious after a single encounter with the Stun Baton. It has been designed by using existing counter-rioting stun rods and extending them further using cutting-edge technology.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The world's best biophysicists have developed this piece of technology through extensive testing on terrestrial organisms, so due to lack of test subjects the Stun Baton might not be completely effective against extraterrestrial beings as it is with terrestrial ones. Although an on-board computer automatically calculates the estimated force needed to incapacitate the target, it has not been programmed using Alien specifications; thus it may err when encountering Alien targets with vastly different physiologies than the ones used for testing.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Externally, the Stun Baton appears to be like any other crowd controlling device, with a handle and a tip that discharges a powerful electric shock. On the interior, however, is one of the most impressive technological displays in any modern weapon. The precise voltage required is determined by the aforementioned computer. Within milliseconds, the Stun Baton’s capacitor charges to the required amount, and the weapon is ready for use. As the tip of the baton makes contact with an enemy, an electrical shock disperses into the target's body, targeting two places in particular: the voluntary nervous system and the heart. Both are severely disrupted by minimal electrical shock; the only trouble is administering the correct voltage. For example, if the voltage is too great, critical damage may be done to the nervous system, and in particular, the heart; cardiac arrest and death may occur very quickly. On the other hand, if the voltage and consequent electrical current are too low, then the subject may either be unaffected, or merely stunned for a very short period of time. The latter case is generally preferable, and this is why the computer within the device has been programmed to err on the side of caution, in line with current riot control models. This safety feature helps prevent accidental deaths.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Research Division advises that this weapon be used cautiously and sparingly in tactical situations, as actual contact is required with the enemy to ensure that this weapon is effective. </paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Stun Launcher is a useful piece of alien technology, for both sides of the conflict. In our case, it allows for capturing living aliens at a range, and thus effectively eliminates the melee requirements of the Stun Baton. It's ability to stun is not limited to a single target, but is spread out in a large area. This ability enables it to be used ageanst large packs of aliens, and still preserve it's stun effect. The Stunning capabilities are much more powerful than that of our Stun Batons, but due to the spread, targets further away from the center of the blast may still be standing after a hit. However, in a direct hit, it is powerful enough to take down the greatest of our foes. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Inside the Stun Launcher are various components to house the Stun Bomb, designed to prevent an accident that would stun the user. One of such components is a gelatinous substance that makes sure the Stun Bomb won’t move when the gun is shaken. We have not been able to reproduce this substance, but we found out that it's structually very similar to ballistics gel. As such, it can easily be replicated without any side effects. The Stun Bomb itself is cradled in the front part of the gun, where a locking mechanism, imbedded in the gel, keeps it in place. When fired, the mechanism, along with the gel, slides back into a small chamber, allowing the Stun Bomb through.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Stun Launcher is reloaded by holding down the trigger to unlatch the locking mechanism, as when fireing the gun. From there, another Stun Bomb is loaded into the muzzle. It takes little time, and the gel structure at the back of the chamber will prevent any accidental releases.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Required as ammo for the Stun Launcher, this relatively small object, named simply Stun Bomb, was designed by aliens as a very efficient device to incapacitate humans from a distance. While the exterior of the Stun Bomb seems made of organic-like material, the inside compartments contain Xenium and some other chemicals, all in combination required to render the victim motionless, but also to prevent its death. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The outer layer is made of chemicals that proved to be a very efficient vasodilator, its effect being involved in speeding up the heat-loss process in humans. When the Stun Bomb is launched, as soon as the outer shell touches a hard surface, the interior layers that separate the chemicals inside tears and the sudden reaction disperses most of the active compounds over a large area.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As soon as the dispersed Xenium comes in contact with one of the chemicals found inside the Stun Bomb, a very special effect starts to take place. The relative velocity of the atoms in close proximity with Xenium decreases dramatically, which is the equivalent of a sudden drop of temperature. The decrease of movement is rather selective, ions being more affected than electrons, thus also a big electrostatic charge separation occur simultaneously with the temperature drop.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Thus, the victim muscles get incapacitated by both freezing cold and sudden electric shocks strong enough to make even an elephant shake uncontrollably. The vasodilator compounds amplify the effect, by maintaining blood vessels open, but at the same time they prevent the growth of ice crystals inside the blood and tissues, which is the main cause of cell damage leading to death by cold.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Some other chemicals seem to be taken by the blood flow toward the central nervous system, where they decrease the amplitude of the brainwaves and induce sleepiness, rendering the victim calm and inoffensive. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Even if the aliens might have a very different biochemistry from us, the freezing cold and the electrical shocks will be effective against any unprotected lifeform, which lead to the conclusion that such weapon can be used with relative succes in capturing live aliens without the need to expose our soldiers to the dangers of using Stun Batons.</paragraph>

Its positive features include good handling, high damage, and a high degree of accuracy, but its major drawbacks are its low rate of fire and extreme weight. Depending on the ammunition being used, the "[RL]" produces damage ranging from explosive to incendiary, and it is recommended for situations where the delivery of maximum force outweighs that of other conventional weapons.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Since 1970, the Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire command-link guided (TOW) weapons system has been Earth's leading design in anti-tank warfare. Due to the fact that it either requires a 2-3 man team or vehicle attachment for operation, most military organizations have deemed it too inefficient for use by Special Forces, and they have sought solo-operated alternatives such as the RPG-7, LAW, and SMAW. In November of 2011, a German scientist by the name of Hans Steiner began development of the “Lone Soldat” (LS) Tank Destroyer. By combining the technological advances found in the Titan missile system with the TOW design base, Steiner was able to create a missile and launcher system that catered specifically to infantry in ground warfare. The Rocket Launcher has since developed into Earth’s finest solo-operated anti-tank weapon. As the LS’s reputation for effectiveness grew, so too did its demand. In order to capitalize on this strong demand, manufacturers in Germany limited the LS’s production, making it harder to acquire. Because of this marketing strategy, only government-funded military organizations are able to afford this weapon. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The LS’s 1-meter long stainless steel structure gives it a rugged exterior that protects most of the electrical components housed within, including the "free-floating light amplification scope" used to assist targeting. Operation of the Rocket Launcher is fairly simple; the user places the missile into the rear of the tube where it is locked into place with small spring-operated pressure plates. The LS is then mounted on one shoulder, and targeting is achieved though simple electronic targeting aids. When the trigger is pulled, the rocket propellant ignites, sending the rocket down the tube and on towards its target.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>At each missile's forefront sits the pressure detonator, that is somewhat isolated within a depleted uranium housing. The detonator becomes active 1.3 seconds after launching to prevent premature detonation and injury to the user in case of a malfunction in the launching mechanism. Behind this detonator sits the selected compound (FE/CE, HE, or IC) and behind that, a fuel compartment filled with a modest quantity of aluminized ammonium perchlorate.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Equipment/Motion Sensor</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Motion Sensor is a portable device designed to aid our soldiers in their tactics. It provides a visual background representation of the battlefield and the location of moving objects. It consists of various parts, namely a Receiver module, a Terahertz emitter-receiver, an InfraSense™ module, its computational matrix and the visual display.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Receiver is actually an electromagnetic radiation and ultrasound detector. It captures the according waves (Electromagnetic or sonic ones) and collects information about their intensity. As soon as the receiver detects motion, it directs the T-Ray emitter to send a powerful radiation beam near the possible target in order to obtain more precise readings. Terahertz radiation, popularly called "T-Rays", can penetrate a wide variety of non-conducting materials like clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry, plastic and ceramics without much absorption. So, measurements of adequate accuracy and larger range are achieved than with lower bands of EM radiation. Whenever obstacles such as solid walls interrupt the detection, the InfraSense™ module supports the sensor’s automation. This module is an optimized seismic sensor designed for military use. Extrapolation of the seismic vibrations reveals if it is a moving body or a periodic source. It is sensitive enough to pick up people moving at up to 50m and vehicles up to 150m away. The built-in software can be calibrated to filter-out annoyances like critter movement and wind.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Afterwards, all data is streamed to the computer that processes the information. Its processing power of this miniaturized portable computer is still challenged by the huge amount of data to be processed, making it impractical to obtain full spectrum images or Friend-Or-Foe recognition. Therefore, heartbeat detection is beyond the sensitivity of the detector. The device accurately detects the position of any moving mass in the immediate vicinity of the user, revealing the presence of any potential incoming attacker, although stationary enemies are not revealed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>An OLED screen guarantees clear display and power-saving operation. Before each mission, a satellite image of the battlefield area is uploaded on the device and serves as background. Large body movements are observed accurately on the small display as bright dots on a darker background in order to allow simple readings and eliminate confusion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A high-capacitance lithium battery provides energy for five hours of endless operation. Additionally, a kinetic dynamo takes advantage of the soldier’s movement and converts kinetic energy into electricity, which charges the battery.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The X-Corps tactical board recommends the use of the Motion sensor device. The location of the enemy is a key-knowledge to success and will definitely improve the odds of X-Corps operatives on the battlefield. In order to provide our platoons with this valuable support, the manufacturing costs for this device were held to a minimum.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Plastic explosives have been applied to a variety of uses since their invention in the early-20th century, mainly in construction and military operations. They are a favorite of special forces because of their stability, moldability, and their ease of transport and storage.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Satchel Charge has many similarities with the much more common C4 explosive, but it is much more powerful and sophisticated. The four-kilogram Satchel Charge consists of four wide bars of a special plastic explosive held together by a layer of heat-resistant alloy. The front-mounted digital touch screen receives user input and displays the countdown timer.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The plastic explosive used in the device is the new Blend &amp; White Plastic®, a highly refined mixture of RDX-rich Torpex and a binder that greatly enhances its malleable consistency, such that it resembles modeling clay or cement. The explosive known as RD-X (Rapid Detonation) is the commercial name of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, also known as cyclonite or hexogen, which is a white crystalline solid in its pure synthesized state. It is often mixed with other explosives (such as TNT), plasticizers, and/or desensitizers. Torpex is a common mixture which contains 42% TNT, 40% RDX and 18% aluminum.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Satchel Charge is stable in storage and is considered the most powerful and brisant military-grade high explosive. The revolutionary manufacturing process patented by Blend and White eliminates the risk of premature detonations and results in an explosive that is quite stable at high temperatures and almost impervious to flame. These qualities make Blend and White the best plastic explosive for battlefield use.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Entering the activation code primes the explosive and prompts the user to set the countdown timer. Once activated, however, the only way to defuse or reset the Satchel Charge is through the successful input of the deactivation code. Our operatives have been thoroughly trained in the use of this device to prevent accidental detonations. A minimal operating distance should always be maintained, and seeking cover during detonation is highly advised. With careful tactical use, the Satchel Charge can be a effective tool in combat situations.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The standard grenade for X-Corps infantry is the MH82 Fragmentation Grenade. The size and weight constraints of hand-thrown devices limit the amount of explosive contained within the grenade, giving the MH82 a smaller blast radius than the Satchel Charge. Despite this fact, it remains a deadly and effective tool of destruction. The shape of the grenade ensures easy use; however, even though aerodynamic principles were accounted for/addressed in the MH82's design, its precision depends primarily on the target distance and the throwing ability of the user.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"Grenade ["nade"]; noun; Great for clearing areas. Prime, throw, boom. Everyone should have one."</paragraph>
        <bullet>Fighting for Dummies</bullet>
        <paragraph>The MH82 grenade is comprised of 3 principal parts: shell, charge and detonator:</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The shell is composed of hardened aluminium foam, which allows for a greater explosive capacity while maintaining an optimal mass. It fragments into shrapnel by the force of the explosion, increasing the effective incapacitating range of the blast.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The charge of the grenade consists of Blend &amp; White Plastic®, a very stable plastic-explosive, making the MH82 Fragmentation Grenade the safest, yet deadliest among commercially available hand-thrown explosive weaponry.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unlike traditional grenades which use a chemical fuse, the MH82 has been fitted with a time-adjustable electromagnetic detonator. Before throwing the grenade, the soldier can set a specific countdown-timer using a dial set into the top of the device. As an additional safety measure, a concealed deactivation mechanism has been integrated, allowing the defusing of the grenade for those who know the location of the concealed buttons and the order in which they have to be pressed. Note that once the priming trigger is released, the MH82 is activated and can only be defused by pressing the correct sequence of safety buttons. Special caution is advised when operating under the influence of toxic substances or when seriously injured. If loss of consciousness occurs before the grenade can be deactivated, the result can be fatal.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Equipment/Proximity Grenade</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Proximity Grenade contains a single switch connected to a battery, integrated computational circuitry, miniaturized detectors, a stabilizer and also a large quantity of powerful explosive, all enveloped in a lightweight titanium shell. Its shell is designed for maximum stability and efficiency. It offers specific tactical advantages no other weapon can. Among such advantages are setting traps from a distance, securing areas and passages and increasing the vulnerability of any incoming attacker. The Proximity Grenades are available commercially and delivered promptly by reliable army suppliers, decreasing the burden on our engineers and allowing them to focus on more important tasks. The Proximity Grenade is powerful and effective even against well-armored targets.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After priming, a pressure detector on the underside of the grenade determines if the device is settled on the ground. If not, the stabilizer vibrates until it the device stands perpendicular to the ground. The shape of the grenade also aids to its stability. Once upright, the movement detection circuits are activated. Then, it acts as a landmine triggered by nearby movement. Since the movement detection is simplified and indiscriminating, the use of Proximity Grenades in populated areas is not recommended.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The highly stable and very powerful explosive within the Proximity Grenade is a moldable mixture containing cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, also known as cyclonite or hexogen, which is a white crystalline solid in its pure synthesized state, shock inhibitors, radical stabilizers and plasticizers, which are all triggered via an electro-thermal detonator.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When the piezoelectric proximity detector receives land or air vibrations characteristic of moving ground targets, it triangulates the distance and velocity of the moving target based on the proximity detector's continuous readings. Objects traveling faster than a few meters per second, like thrown objects, explosions, or fired ammunition, are too fast to be analyzed -and thus considered as targets- and subsequently ignored, but slower movements are presumed to be coming from targets. Once such target enters within a threshold distance, the detection circuit trips the detonator, which triggers the RDX-based explosive within the next compartment. The resulting explosion has a large blast radius and can hurt and probably kill human targets. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>In order to prevent accidental casualties, all Proximity Grenades must be deactivated, to prevent minefield like conditions as those in the World Wars. When the battle is over, a computer onboard the transport can translate the deactivation code into a uniquely modulated sequence of engine core vibrations and transmit them over the entire battle area. Upon receiving the deactivating code, the Proximity Grenades self-disarm, and the inert grenades are collected and stored for later use.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>As any soldier with experience fighting the Alien menace will probably say, the Aliens' main strength lies in their weaponry and its superiority to our equivalents. In no case is this more obvious than in the comparison between Alien grenades and our own fragmentation grenades. Although each design aims for identical goals (i.e. an area effect, hand thrown explosive weapon), they achieve this aim in remarkably different ways, both in principal and complexity. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Xenium-122 within the Alien grenade is critically destabilized by application of a resonant magnetic field. As the Xenium within the grenade unfolds, its stored energy is released at a vast rate, mainly in the forms of radiation and high-energy atomic particles. (Note: Staring directly at an Alien grenade’s explosion can lead to temporary or permanent damage to the retina, and should be avoided at all costs). The ionization on a large scale is apparent in the form of high-energy plasma. The resulting plasma shockwave causes catastrophic damage to the affected material, surrounding environment, and in a biological case is likely to cause a very rapid death. Radiation burns will also be present in non-shielded targets within line of sight.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unlike fragmentation grenades, Alien grenades can cause severe damage to hardened metals by melting them and consequently may prove effective against armored Alien opponents or any other metal-based foe.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In a vacuum there is less material for the grenade to ionize and the plasma will cool rapidly resulting in a less severe shockwave. The majority to the energy will escape as hard radiation, which will flash fry the surrounding area sufficiently to cause noticeable damage to hard targets at medium range. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>While we are able to produce this weapon, Xenium-122 is required for its manufacturing; no substitutions of any kind can be done.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The M18 Smoke Grenade can be used for ground-to-ground and ground-to-air signaling, landing zone marking, and providing cover for unit movement in combat situations; the latter will most certainly make the Smoke Grenade a valuable asset to X-Corps ground operations. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>In many ways, the M18 Smoke Grenade is similar to the MH82 Fragmentation Grenade. The M18 shares the same time-adjustable fuse, dorsal-mounted countdown dial, and concealed deactivation mechanism as the MH82. However, the similarities between the two grenades end at their modes of operation.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Smoke Grenade’s steel casing has several emission holes at the top and bottom to disperse smoke after ignition. The core contains the two-component "smoke mix" embedded as seperated microglobules in a suppressive matrix that doubles as a dispersion charge. This matrix can be triggered to rapidly oxidize by applying an electric current, causing the two components to mix and pushing the thick smoke out of the emission holes. Soldiers should note that the reaction does not rely on atmospheric oxygen, so trying to douse the reaction using standard fire-extinguishing methods will show no effect.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The M18's payload of colored smoke mixture creates a thick enough smoke to provide cover during a combat mission. This allows operatives to disembark from a transport under cover in relative safety, or provide smokescreens for exposed flanks during a withdrawal. The Smoke Grenade can also be used offensively, causing disorientation by limiting visual references. In confined quarters such as building interiors, the use of the M18 in this capacity is particularly effective. Attention should be given to the fact that visibility will also be impaired for friendly units. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Operatives are advised to avoid holding the M18 during smoke dispersion as it represents a burn hazard. Also note that the smoke displaces normal air, including oxygen. While breathing is still possible even inside thick smoke screens, prolonged exposure can cause dizziness, headaches and potentially loss of consciousness.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Using the Smoke Grenade in poorly ventilated areas without proper gear is strongly discouraged by the manufacturer.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>With the Flashpod, our soldiers are able to efficiently illuminate selected areas.  This battlefield lighting is important during nighttime missions, as it makes it easier for our soldiers to spot enemies while advancing towards the target. It also allows them to create a defense perimeter to prevent surprise attacks by enemies lurking in the shadows.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Like its predecessors, this area illumination device uses phosphorus as its most important component. Unlike them, however, the system uses electrical stimulation to create a similar effect. This is a considerable improvement, as it means that the device is not only reusable, but also does not exhibit the exothermic side-effects involved in the use of the previous versions.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"Well, this was long overdue. Those old flare-thingies kept burning holes in my pockets." - Rookie Thomas "Firebutt" Richter</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Based on the new principle called Phospho-Electro-Luminescence (PEL), the Flashpod is composed of just two parts: accumulator and PEL screen.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The accumulator resides in the center of the round device and can be recharged quickly through the Flashpod's integrated power socket. The factory-default accumulator is rated for 30Ah at operating current, and is capable of sustaining a light output of 1900 ANSI lumen for over a day.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The PEL screen has been made possible by recent advances in nanotechnology, allowing us to use a marvelous semiconductive polymer that is cheap to produce, moldable into any shape, lightweight, and capable of electricity-to-light conversion with unprecedented efficiency. The screen is composed of macromolecules that can be doped with various elements, each creating a unique spectrum of emitted wavelengths. After experimenting with several different combinations, a mixture of chromium, iridium and yttrium was chosen for its superior ability to produce a spectrum of emitted light which does not impair the night-vision of our soldiers. This is achieved by suppressing those wavelengths that trigger the human eye's light-adaptation. The resulting crimson glow is still more than sufficient to illuminate the surrounding area, allowing early spotting and identification of enemies.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The PEL screen is integrated into the translucent envelope of the device. This tough, shatter-proof and fire-resistant polymer casing makes the Flashpod impervious to standard environmental conditions. In fact, every reported case of "spontaneous loss of function" later was found to involve improper use of explosives.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>For easy de-activation, each Flashpod's casing has three concealed buttons situated at intervals easily accessible to human hands. When all three buttons are pressed simultaneously, the device is switched off until rethrown, allowing the same Flashpod to be used several times over the course of a mission as needed without revealing the position of the carrier to enemy fire.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Since World War II, every soldier has carried a medical kit of some sort. In the last 70 years, this piece of medical technology has evolved considerably. Long ago, field medics often had to make do with the meager supplies contained within a medikit: crude surgical tools, simple iron splints, and ragged cloth bandages. Today, the Field Medical Kit Mk IV provides our soldiers the wonders of cutting-edge medical treatment without having any prior medical knowledge</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Please note, however, that usage of a Field Medical kit only stabilizes a soldier temporarily, additional treatment is generally necessary upon returning to base.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Field Medical Kit contains everything necessary to administer first aid and stabilize a soldier on the battlefield. It makes it possible to stop hemorrhaging, calm mental distress, and chemically invigorate a soldier during combat. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This marvel of medical science must be held against the wounded soldier in order to provide treatment. The Mark IV has three available functions: </paragraph>
        <paragraph>1. Hemo-patch: the hemo-patch contains a large quantity of coagulation agents suspended in a platelet-rich gel, capable of stopping severe bleeding. Painkillers inhibit pain receptors around the wound, and an antibiotic solution prevents the onset of infection. Note: light numbing around a treated area is possible, but normal sensation returns after few days.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>2. Antipsychotic: a highly experimental combination of Chlorpromazine, Haloperidol, and Olanzapine. Clozapine is used to bring a soldier out of a psychotic episode much faster than normally possible. While effective in returning a soldier to a normal mental state during combat, this treatment requires detoxification within 24 hours to avoid long-term damage central nervous system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>3. Psychotropic: animethylphenitine (AMP) is a synthetic stimulant mixture consisting of methylphenidate and amineptine. A dose of this synthetic adrenalin allows a tired or unconscious soldier to recover enough energy to continue the mission. Follow-up medical attention is recommended due to the potential "crash" as this medication wears off. WARNING: Do not administer this stimulant to normally functioning subjects; excessive use has induced a frenzy-like hysteria in test subjects.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>There is a very limited quantity of drugs available: use the device only when absolutely necessary</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Field Medical Kit Mark IV must be recharged in a laboratory to prevent contamination. There had been numerous cases of field infections from the usage of the field-refillable Field Medical Kit Mk III.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>This unusual orb-like alien device is an extremely complex arrangement of alien micro-processors and  circuitry. After extensive research it is clear that this device is some form of alien communication device which utilizes brainwaves to relay information. The metallic outer layer has many microscopic dimples to increase the surface area, acting like an antenna to intercept as many brainwaves as possible. While the amazingly complex micro-supercomputer inside converts the waves so that they are compatible with the users brain, relaying the message directly to the users mind, instantly and with an accuracy of over 99%. In short, it picks up brainwaves and converts one format of brainwave into the user’s format, this allows communication between different species with different brain structures. Fortunately, due to our brains similarity to some alien races the [Mind Probe] can be used by [X-Corp] units in combat situations. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the semi hieroglyphic alien language our scientists are as yet unable to decipher a single word and to learn would be near impossible. Therefore, its use is restricted to emotions intercepted from the target, such as morale, physical status, any equipment they are carrying along with an assortment of statistics about the targets condition and rank. This is a very complex but useful piece of technology, that has great use on a battle scene, but it is not without its limits. Firstly, the user must be in visual contact of the target and secondly, the device takes quite a bit of time to use due to its cumbersome design, size and its minimal compatibility with the human mind.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The Psionic Amplifier allows the user to control an enemy's mind, or panic an enemy unit. To use this device with any real chance of success, extensive mental training is required to prepare a Human mind for the shock of encountering, and then attacking an Alien mind. Certain individuals are found to be more psionically capable, however, after evaluation at a Psionic Training Facility. These individuals seem to have a much higher psi talent than most other individuals, and show promise if we continue research into the psionic realm of science. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>During the cold war the knowledge on mind-bending techniques radically increased due to large amounts of government funding. The aim of these secret black projects was mainly intelligence-based, where psychic spies would use their abilities to find vital information such as enemy capabilities, weapons sites and other classified information that would be otherwise irretrievable. Although most project achieved some degree of success, in most cases the information retrieved proved to be completely inaccurate an incorrect, there were, however, few cases in which the data retrieved was accurate enough to prove valuable. Unfortunately, research into this phenomenon did not progress much further and funding was totally cut in most projects, as the scientists felt they were stuck in a dead end. It seemed clear that the Human race possessed some untapped ability, yet we had no method of using it effectively.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, after further examination of certain 'psionically active' Aliens we have found an unusual type of enzyme secreted by these that reacts strongly to neural activity. This unusual substance amplifies brain waves, emits them to its surroundings, and can cause severe neural shock to any biological matter it encounters. This can cause a stunning effect, disorientation or in rare cases it stops the brain functioning for a period of time, enabling the attacker to control the target’s actions using its mind.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This would be an invaluable resource for our forces and this neural enzyme can be synthesized easily using a quick biochemical process. Unfortunately, we are still unsure of its affects on the human anatomy. Therefore, using existing neural technology, we have developed the [color]Psionic Amplifier[/color]. Rather than harboring a potentially hazardous enzyme within the user's body, it will be contained inside a hand-held weapon with an array of neural transceivers to focus the otherwise diffused waves. It receives the user’s brain waves via digital pulses from a microchip implanted on the back of the neck. After preliminary experiments with this device, we have found that for those untrained users and those with low psionic capabilities, the introduction of this new ‘sense’ will most definitely cause excessive emotional and mental stress. This device is incredibly useful, but its users must be well-trained in its use, be in visual range of their target, and must use caution in using it as it is still highly experimental.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-CORPS STANDARD ISSUE BATTLE DRESS</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Armor/Standard</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The design of most general purpose body armor reflects the environment and stresses from which it is meant to protect the wearer. The X-Corps Standard Issue Battle Dress Uniform is no exception. Meant to provide lifesaving protection in unforeseeable circumstances against an unknown arsenal of alien weaponry, X-Corps’ uniforms are a combination of the best that Mankind has to offer in comfort, camouflage, and, of course, protection. The uniform consists of a helmet, a shirt with additional armor on chest and back, gloves, pants, and boots. These are usually supplemented with a utility belt and backpack.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The material of the helmet, shirt, gloves, and pants consists primarily of a four-ply material, which X-Corps has patented as Monoflex. The outermost and innermost layers are an extremely tough silk/synthetic spider silk mesh, with a reflective ultra fine fiberoptic screen woven in to provide not only heat and radiation protection, but to generally reduce the wearer's visibility without compromising fine motor skills or general range of motion. Beneath this is a thin layer of traditional Kevlar, supplemented with light ceramic inserts on either side of the torso. The last layer consists of a modified form of the NASA material known as aerogel (gelified glass dried into a smoky substance consisting primarily of air, and weighing 2 mg per cubic centimeter). The X-Corps’ Research Division found a way to effectively perform this technique on a combination of glass and nylon, forming a weightless, highly insulating, yet flexible and strong form of fiberglass, the keystone of Monoflex. This material, nicknamed fibergel, can be kept at a temperature appropriate to the environment in which it is to be used, and will retain that temperature for well over the duration of even the most extreme missions. It also functions as insulation against all but the most extreme forms of electrical and heat energy, as well as against many high energy particles. The thickness of the uniform is 1,3 cm, or 3,8 cm with inserts, on the chest and back. The front of the uniform detaches easily at the left shoulder, allowing for easy torso access in a medical emergency. The helmet has much thicker layers of fibergel and Kevlar, as well as a laser-etched hyperbolic steel shell capable of deflecting most projectiles. An attached headset connects each X-Corps agent to his superiors, and has a pull-down screen over the right eye with Shodan target acquisition and evaluation software. The gloves have an additional layer of foam rubber for grip, as well as a readout on the back of the left hand connected to pulse detection systems and linked up to a central unit, usually in the XC-11, showing current time, life signs, and general mission-relevant data, including relative location of all other agents.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Boots are constructed of thicker layers of these materials, including an especially tough, stiff mesh covering, a stout layer of fibergel giving increased heat absorption, and inner padding for comfort in large area missions. They have traditional cleated rubber soles.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The utility belt is constructed of the same material as the inner and outer uniform fabric, and has several pockets, hooks, attachment points, and two holsters. It also has a small emergency broadcasting unit in case of separation from the main force. The backpack connects directly to the uniform via four small hooks, distributing its weight mainly to the shoulders and hips. It is also formed from a silk/synthetic spider silk mesh coupled with a reflective weave. Its simple construction allows it to be folded and stored in an agent's belt pocket when unused.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>"I was pretty sceptical of the new suit when I first slipped it on - it seemed like any other uniform I'd ever worn, only maybe a little thicker and heavier. I joked that it was an excuse to get us to carry around a little more weight than usual, you know, doing drills. Then, one day we were doing a mock-up bug hunt in an abandoned factory. Apparently, the place still had some gas in the tanks and pipes that were running everywhere in that building, 'cause we banged some of 'em up pretty good, and when Sergeant Foster lit up a little too close to them, a great big fireball just kinda washed over him. He was hurt pretty bad, his face was all burnt and I guess he broke some of his ribs, but he lived. The worst part was that when we went to pull him outta the building, his suit, I mean his WHOLE uniform...it was barely even warm."</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The Alien menace is a threat beyond anything we could have ever prepared ourselves for, nothing we could have ever planned for. We are rapidly finding ourselves outmanned, outmaneuvered, and outgunned. This war requires a new kind of soldier to fight a new kind of enemy. We have to respond quickly and effectively, minimizing both their strengths and our weaknesses. Reports reveal that the distinct Alien species are either heavily armored or possess thick hides which appear to be bulletproof in a small degree, this obliges us to make use of new, vastly powerful weapons. This, however, is not enough. We need to stem the losses we are sustaining in the face of the awesome killing power of the enemy’s technology. To this end, we have used what we know about the material known as Alien Composites they use in their hulls and equipment to create a new kind of personal armor. This will finally bring us to an equal footing with the Alien threat.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Once X-Corps’ scientists and technicians discovered how to manufacture and control a stable culture of the organic component of the Aliens' incredibly robust Composites, it was relatively simple to mold it into an armored suit, well suited for X-Corps’ particular tactical needs. Initial attempts to combine the Composites with other forms of armor, including any of the various materials present in Monoflex, were unsuccessful. No process our science teams used could fuse the strange material with any other substance. The enzymes present seemed to recognize anything unlike the Composites themselves, and either reject it as foreign, or incorporate it, molecule by molecule, into the layers of the Alien material. This has posed some problem, since the ceramic layer of the material itself acts as a superconductor, making the suit rise or lower instantly to the surrounding temperature.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Scientists have yet to discover what method of physiological or technical enhancement allows the Aliens themselves to withstand this variation in temperature, so we have incorporated a fibergel undergarment into the armor's design. Although it has been found that the danger posed by the Composites' voracious enzymes can be bypassed simply by allowing the organic layer to form a complete silicon and carbon cellule mesh throughout the outer metallic layer before exposing anyone to the material, the properties of the organic layer are still largely unknown, and the effects of damage on the Alien Composites is still being tested. Therefore, the enzyme-resistant fibergel undergarment is considered necessary for the time being, as environmental protection, additional energy protection, and protection from the armor itself.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The armor consists of one large, continuous segment of material. Alien Composites are sturdy and rigid where thick, and elastic and flexible where thin, so it was actually relatively simple for our technicians to put together a full suit of body armor for our soldiers. The suits are manufactured in generic sizes, which, after being worn for less than a day, will conform to the measurements of the individual soldier, long-term stresses causing the organic layer to "re-shuffle" the other layers to a comfortable fit. Due to the nature of the material and the fact that it cannot be formed into buttons or zippers, hooks are used for securing. It is formed into a single piece body suit which attaches along the back, so that to put it on, a soldier steps into it like a fencing vest. Cleated boots, gloves, an open hood, and holsters, pockets, and hooks at the waist are all incorporated into this design. A backpack made of the same material hooks onto the back. These are all similar in construction to the Battle Dress Uniform, including the attached headset and HUD, and the glove's personal readout.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The MK IV "Praetorian" Combat Powersuit is the result of research into Alien technologies combined with basic Human ingenuity. Much stronger than our Combat Armor, this Powersuit can protect the wearer from the devastating effects of the Aliens' plasma weapons yet does not adversely affect the mobility of the user in any way. We have projected that if every agent is equipped with the Praetorian, casualties in the field will be reduced by as much as thirty percent. As such, we recommend that mass immediate mass production of the Praetorian.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"At first I was not too sure about the new armor. I mean the damn thing looks like it weighs a quarter ton even without weapons and ammo, and I'm supposed to fight wearing this thing? I was expecting to get my uh- "hindquarters" handed to me by the XCAPs. But once I powered up and finally got it calibrated right, it felt no different from my duty uniform. I managed to take down four of the tanks, and really screwed the last one up before it got me. I can't wait to see the looks on the bug's faces when we show up in these!"</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Powered armors have always been seen as the ultimate answer in improving the effectiveness of soldiers on the battlefield, and black-box programs developing these powered armors were set up by various international agencies since as early as the 1990s. Although various degrees of success were achieved, they all were stumped by the design constraints of producing a relatively inexpensive, lightweight, yet strong and responsive motor control system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A US Army advanced weapons design team in the late 90's developed the predecessor of today's Electro Active Polymers in the late 1990's as a base for the motive system. Their work eventually led to what are now commonly referred to as "Myomers", bundles of Electro Active Polymers that mimic the muscles in the human body. With the new motive system, they went on to develop the first working prototype powered armor suits, the Ogre-01.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, due to the high density of Electro Active Polymers in each bundle of myomer, the energy requirements of the Ogre-01 prototype were too high. The prototype was bulky, slow, and seriously underpowered. Also, the prototype had to be tethered to a power station in order to be active for extended periods of time. As a result, the development committee decided to shelve the project; all prototypes were mothballed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, our research into the Aliens' Xenium Reactors, as well as the unique Alien Composites, allowed the project to be reactivated under X-Corps' control, successfully developing the first working power armor system; functionally named ?Combat Powersuit? Mark IV, dubbed the Praetorian. Also, with the use of recently developed advanced materials, the power consumption of the myomer groupings was reduced to a satisfactory amount. The Praetorian is powered by a pair of miniaturized Xenium-122 rechargeable power cells which store enough internal charge to last 84 straight hours of active use. The power cells can be recharged by hooking into any Xenium-122 based generator.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The myomer system is designed to only support the weight of the Praetorian effortlessly, as previous strength-enhancing prototypes proved near impossible to control. Simply put, the myomers act as a sort of ?power steering' that allows the user to move as if he was wearing far less than a 114,76 kg suit of battle armor.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Each suit is fully adjustable, and is fitted to the individual specifications of each soldier to provide a snug fit. The control system consists in a series of pressure-sensitive pads that are built into the innermost layer. The pads are placed along major movement points such as the joints, neck and especially around the hands and shoulders. When pressure is applied onto the pads by the movement of the wearer, information regarding the pressure exerted onto the pad is transmitted to a CPU which then stimulates the appropriate myomer bundles. Also, the wearer is provided with force-feedback system via a series of carbon dioxide-activated air bladders built into the innermost lining of the Praetorian powersuit. As such, very little training is required as with proper calibration the Praetorian will effectively move with the wearer as if it was just a basic uniform.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The user's vitals are tracked automatically by the medical computer situated next to the main CPU, should the armor detect a breach of suit integrity accompanied by an abnormal change in the soldier's vital statistics, any one of the carbon dioxide bladders can be inflated to act in its secondary role of applying pressure as close to the wound as possible. If ordered to by the medical computer or by manual command from either the soldier himself or a medic, the armor will apply this pressure directly to the closest major artery, acting as a tourniquet.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The actual protection offered by this new armor makes it far and away the most durable protective garment ever developed by mankind to date. The Alien Composites that make up the surface of the armor are layered in some places over twelve times thicker than our old Combat Armors. In the laboratory, one chest plate stood up to three direct hits from an Alien Heavy Plasma Rifle weapon before failing, and even then, the damage sensors underneath indicated that had the test in fact been a real combat, the soldier would have most likely survived, and perhaps even able to return to duty eventually.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Truly, this represents one of our greatest steps towards levelling the playing field with the Aliens, and winning this war.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Anti-grav Powersuit Mark III, "Icarus", is the next phase in personal armor design. Not only does it provide better protection than the Praetorian; the Icarus also provides our agents with better tactical flexibility by allowing them to move freely above the engagement area. Unfortunately, a design compromise resulted in the Icarus having rear armor plating weaker than that of the Praetorian's due to the location of the flight system backpack in that area.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Anti-grav Powersuit Mark I "Flying Praet" was initially developed as an extension of the Praetorian design. That is to say, to provide our field agents with better tactical flexibility by redesigning the suit to include a small anti-gravity device. Also, as a next generation extension of the Praetorian, the design also included various upgrades, including an upgraded version of the medicomp, enhanced flexibility, and reworked myomer bundles that reduced the powersuit's weight. Also, heat dissipaters developed for use with the anti-grav generators enabled the suit to disperse plasma hits more effectively, increasing the suit's defenses against such weapons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, while we were able to develop anti-gravity generators both small and efficient enough to provide sustainable flight, the complexity involved with controlling the hovering suit required controls too complex to integrate into a suit's control system without interfering with an agent's combat awareness. As a result, the development of the Mark I "Flying Praet" was put on hold while we studied the Alien Navigation Systems for a solution.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>By developing a simplified version of the navigation systems used by the aliens, we essentially allowed the wearer to control the suits' flight by using their minds. Initial trials showed great promise with the suits pulling off advanced acrobatics in midair with ease. However, just as the Anti-grav Powersuit Mark II was entering preproduction phase, an average of three out of four of the test pilots started exhibiting signs of psychosis and severe paranoia, to the extent that all three had to be sedated and placed under watch in order to prevent them from injuring themselves as well as other personnel.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Extensive review of the recorder flight data as well as the design suggested that the difficulty involved with controlling every single detail of the suit's flight resulted in severe stress for the Human mind which was simply not designed to process that much information, resulting in a chemical imbalance in the brain as well as neuronal "burnout" from being psionically active for extended periods of time. Unfortunately, we were only able to jury-rig a neural engram buffer to simulate ninety percent of the required input/output to maintain level flight, and in the due process, limit the suits to basic movements along the horizontal and vertical planes.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A fortunate side effect of the redesign was that the occupant was sufficiently "disconnected" from the suit that user doesn’t actually feel pain when the armor is hit, and that unlike the alien's mental control systems, the occupants won’t die if they disconnect from the armor's flight control system in a hurry.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We still hope to be able to finalize a design that would enable our field agents to fly through the skies freely, but due to the time constraints, are forced to field the Anti-grav Powersuit Mark III as it is right now.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"I tell you, those things move on their own! Mine was planning on eating me and I knew because of the freaky mental control systems those scientists cooked up. I had to kill it before it found out I knew its plans!"</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>When establishing a new base, the construction of a Base Access is the first thing necessary. After that, additional modules can be built. The Base Access is the primary way into or out of an X-Corps' underground base. Therefore it is also a potential entry point for hostile units in case of an attack.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Base Access provides transportation to the surface via a large hydraulic lift. The lift can be used for heavy equipment and bulk supplies as well as personnel, and is equipped with a back-up power system allowing evacuation even when cut off from the main line. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>With X-Corps operating in secrecy, the Base Access is always well-concealed. The lift platform moves up to ground level when fully extended, with the covering bulkhead doors sliding back to the sides. Depending on the environment, the bulkheads are painted and fitted with appropriate camouflage - including artificial plants, rocks, or anything else our experts come up with. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Operation of the lift is controlled exclusively from the inside, with hidden surveillance equipment installed around the Base Access allowing detection and identification of personnel.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, these safety measures will only be of limited use in the case of an attack against the base. The aliens very likely have the means necessary to open the bulkhead doors, making the Base Access the most probable point of entry along with the Hangars. In case of an alien attack on one of our bases, it is therefore strongly advised to keep these entry points under guard, preferably by soldiers equipped with heavy weaponry.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>As our operations expand, the need for additional personel arises and Barracks Facilities provide the necessary living arrangements. X-Corps recognizes the need for rested and relaxed staff, therefore a lot of effort was put into making accomodations as comfortable as possible within the very restrictive space our base design is able to offer.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>To ensure undisturbed recreational and relaxation time, the Barracks Facilities' external walls are filled with a heat and sound insulating polymer, acting as protection from adverse environmental factors. This, combined with the ergonomic design and built-in recreation facilities, creates a comfortable environment able to house up to 48 people.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Each Baracks Facility contains the following elements:</paragraph>
        <bullet> A small galley kitchen, allowing the personnel to cook meals for themselves and providing all needed space, equipment and a large variety of edible goods.</bullet>
        <bullet> A disseverable recreation/living room equipped with home cinema equipment and a convertable multi-purpose table allowing usage as dining, pool or ping-pong table.</bullet>
        <bullet> Sleeping accommodations similar to the "capsule hotel" bunk bed design. There are in total 24 soundproof capsules which are occupied in two shifts. Each capsule is 1.5m x 1.5m x 3m and contains a comfortable bed, lockers and a thin client with multimedia features and broadband network access allowing for free VoIP calls and internet browsing.</bullet>
        <bullet> A small bathroom for every four bunks.</bullet>
        <bullet> Collapsible spaces inside the walls that add to the total storage volume available, where personel can keep their personal items, equipment, devices and medical supplies. In addition, pads and weights are available for the soldiers' daily exercise routine.</bullet>
        <bullet> A large interactive monitor which not only provides information such as schedules or announcements, but also serves as an ultra high definition home theater screen.</bullet>
        <paragraph>Each base that requires resident personnel, such as soldiers, scientists or engineers, must include at least one Barracks Facility.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Base/Facilities/Laboratory</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Our initial intelligence reports tell us that the Aliens are using highly advanced craft and armaments; their movements are seemingly erratic, and their motives unknown. Conventional weapons seem ineffective against them and our toughest armor is easily penetrated by their weaponry. Against these almost impossible odds, our greatest and only weapon is science.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Since we are not familiar with Alien technology, our laboratories must cover all aspects of modern science. Due to the base module size restriction of 25x25 meters, the research area was conceptualized as an adaptable workspace. The laboratory has a design that is easily customized to focus on one specific subject or several smaller ones. Up to 50 scientists, usually organized in three 8-hour shifts, can work in a single laboratory.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When not in use, this facility features little other than a large, seemingly nondescript L-shaped workbench. Connections for easy access to distilled water, electrical power, laboratory gases and a vacuum exhaust system are integrated into the sides of the counter at regular intervals. Moreover, it provides ample storage space for a multitude of fully customizable devices and instruments. Sterile laminar airflow hoods for biological research, anti-electrostatic mats for sensitive electronics and shielded, remote-controlled workspace for hazardous materials are additional modules that can be set-up when needed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In one corner of the lab a large interactive screen allows easy tracking of workflow, assignment of specific tasks and shows current research results. In addition, Firenet™ nodes located throughout the workbenches provide the scientists with lightning fast wireless connections for optimal information exchange.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Anticipating a need to examine live specimens, a small, high security Alien containment area with added analysis capabilities is included. Integrated into its walls are sensory devices ranging from passive acoustic and optic sensors up to full spectrum EM imagers as well as several extensible active devices including still film X-Ray, CAT/MRI, neutron and 3D ultrasound scanning devices. Some of the rays used are very hazardous so prolonged presence inside the test chamber during active scans is not advised.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With this design and modular equipment, the X-Corps laboratory module should be more than capable of facing the scientific war that is ahead. However, it should be noted that no lab can function without scientists, and they can only work as fast as humanly possible. For optimal research efficiency building several labs and staffing them with scientists is recommended.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>"Please do be careful Double-oh-Seven. That simple pencil you see has a autogyro powerful enough to demolish a small building" - Robert Asley, slightly deranged XCorps technician </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Initial reports by the research department consider it highly probable that recent breakthroughs and perhaps future research of alien technology will soon allow us to create new weapon prototypes and advanced equipment. Unfortunately, since the existing installations are insufficient for such a task, the Workshop Facility has been designed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The XCorps Workshop has the standardised fifteen-meter square footprint, and provides enough space for 50 technicians to work in a 24-hour period. This does not account for the assembly area however; larger objects being worked on can limit the number of engineers in each facility. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This facility's equipment is capable of producing cutting edge devices, and can be quickly refitted as we integrate future technology. Unfortunately the modular design, which allows this change of focus, is also the primary reason why the workshop will not be as effective as a dedicated assembly line. However we feel this is a fair sacrifice to make in order to be flexible.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Once the research department provides the blueprints for a prototype and the manufacturing room provides the custom components, the workshop's Machine and Electronics Rooms are used to complete the project. Extra raw materials are provided as needed from the Materials Room residing in the upper floor. When the project is complete, it is usually transferred to the General Storage for safekeeping.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In the case of armament such as armor and weapons, the Engineering Workshop also provides a testing area where prototypes can be tested and recalculated. It includes explosion chambers, particle- and radiation-shielded rooms and of course a firing range, which also serves as a backup training range for new recruits who are not familiar with new technology.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Engineering workshop probably won't be needed much in the first days of your operation but we're certain that it will become an invaluable friend once new non-conventional technologies are developed.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Our landing pads have been designed to allow versatile storage of all our aircraft. Regular maintenance and combat repairs can be carried out in this 900m2 facility using the integrated maintenance bay. Flooring grills are used throughout the facility to aid in cleanup; oils and other waste fluids are collected and filtered for proper disposal. Standard refueling procedures are carried out using shielded fuel storage tanks, allowing us to top off an aircraft without fear of fuel leaks and explosions. In addition to a reinforced outer casing, each tank has a flexible Kevlar internal bladder with fire retardant gel between the bladder and the outer casing. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Each landing pad includes a scissor lift platform to raise aircraft to the surface for external take off and landings. While it is possible for our top pilots to perform VTOLs from within the facility, this is considered an excessive risk and could be impossible for a damaged aircraft. The lift is operated by hydraulic presses located under the facility floor, and a ratcheted safety joint in the scissors keeps the ramp from falling in case of total hydraulic failure. The hangar roof is leveled with the landing pad on the surface, and retracts along the facility ceiling using recessed tracks. At full extension the lift is flush with the surface and does not damage the landing gear during take off and landing. The landing pad's external doors consist of reinforced concrete, and are surface camouflaged to match the surrounding area. While capable of supporting a significant amount of weight, these doors might be a potential weak point in our bases’ defense. Once the lift is flush with the surface, the aircraft can follow standard take-off procedures, using VTOL or a built-in catapult launcher from the surface.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Note: Due to recent hazing of recruits, infrared sensors have been installed along the edge of the lift platform and aimed at the ceiling to detect any objects hanging off the edge of the lift and stop its ascent. This is to prevent possible equipment damage or amputation as the lift reaches surface level. Personnel must clear the lift prior to activation.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.Net/Facilities/Psionic Training Facility</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Since the early 30´s scientists have been working on the evaluation of psionic ability in humans. Experiments into this field resulted in varying outcomes, which either rejected the theory as non-rational or promoted it as a "yet unknown scientific issue", but none were successful enough to condone additional funding to the field. Only after the alien encounter we had solid proof to support the existence of this power. After close examination of certain captured alien beings, interestingly we observed that only Cloaks and high ranking Greys are able to make extensive use of their powers, which led us to the identification of an enzyme only produced by these individuals. It is not clear why only high-ranking Greys are able to produce this enzyme, but we suspect a genetic altering by another species that has been performed specifically on these individuals, as the controlling species might fear a loss of control could occur if every alien was capable of using psionic powers. In addition to this, it is highly likable, that only those with superior intelligence and natural psionic talent are chosen to be modified.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, the enzyme resonating to neural activity and amplifying brain waves allows these Aliens to create a strong psionic field, and project it onto an intelligent target. It seems that, though humans possess the ability to create weak psionic fields, compared to those the Aliens create, a profound training of the soldier’s ability to concentrate, especially over longer periods, is crucial for effective use.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Psionic Training Facility contains ten small compartments with several devices allowing an effective training of the soldiers. The heart of each training unit is a device named as psionic projector, which is using the alien enzyme to create a psionic field, forcing the trainees brain to constantly deal with changing influences, while his task is to rapidly adapt his own psionic output to a given pattern countering such an influence, training the soldiers ability to "formulate" his thoughts, thus not only raising his experience with his psi powers but also ensuring his possibility to use them even in highly stressing field situations. To strengthen the candidate's ability to focus on a certain task, new computer programs have been written which constantly monitor the users brain activity during the completion of the above mentioned, and other focus improving tasks, allowing himself and his supervisor to observe the current state of the training and to modify the exercise routine as necessary. A newly developed brain interface device reads the original brainwaves via head mounted electrodes, thus allowing the interpretation not only of the waves which are developed via the soldiers psionic field, but of the intended effect and - interfacing with the Psionic Projector "reinject" the waves into the applicants brain, allowing it to perform a sub cognitional comparison between the desired and the resulting "output".</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In addition to this, extensive psychological sessions are performed since we could confirm numerous personal problems like massive fear, adjustment disorders, depression, self chosen isolation, hallucinations, paranoia, various cases of schizophrenia and suicide attempts,  evolving from excessive use of psionic powers. It seems that, for the untrained brain, confrontation with extrasensory perception has a devastating effect.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>As this war unfolds, it has become increasingly apparent that even state-of-the-art conventional weapons are only having a limited effect against Alien technology. The recent razing of the Cheyenne Mountain NORAD Headquarters by an Alien pre-emptive strike undeniably demonstrates this conclusion. NORAD military bases are considered to be among the best-defended installations on Earth, and their headquarters had been considered a veritable fortress. This further stresses the fact that conventional defense systems are proving less and less effective against the Alien menace; should the invaders shift to a fully offensive posture, we would surely find our bases woefully deficient in defensive firepower. Fortunately, recent developments in laser technology have given us a more effective base defense facility that offers greater protection than our previous [Missile Defense Facility].</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Having overcome recent overcharge and focus problems, the Research Division has provided us with blueprints for the construction of a laser-based Aerial Defense and Countermeasure mechanism. Double laser cannons mounted upon a modified GP-02 turret platform allow full 360-degree rotation within 0.3 seconds and precision tracking, creating the basis for the [Tri-Phase Laser Defense Facility]. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The [Tri-Phase Laser Defense Facility]'s dual cannons are each powered by a single Primary Discharge Capacitor and three secondary capacitors. Once the firing procedure commences, the continually charging secondary capacitors sequentially discharge their stored energies to the primary capacitor. This sequential three-phase release of energies prevents overloading the Primary Discharge Capacitor and gives the laser its "Tri-Phase" moniker. The influx of energy into the lasing matrix causes the material to generate monochromatic light which is then concentrated and released as twin beams along the correct vector.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The platform is also equipped with three constant low-power tracking lasers. Once the operator locks them onto the enemy, they form a triangular path designed to keep the target in the destructive path of the primary laser beams for as long as possible, thereby greatly increasing accuracy and damage potential.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This two-story facility was designed to provide maximum speed and security.  The shielded command room lies on one end of the ground floor, and its reinforced walls offer some security for its occupants.  The main weapon platform and laser turret rest on one side of the central foundation, confined within its own blast-proof enclosure opposite that of the command room: a safety precaution in case they come under attack from hostile aircraft.  A small corridor separating these two rooms doubles as a supply area and buffer zone in case the cannon room is breached.  The basement houses the weapons' foundation and heavy machinery- the power generators, cooling equipment, and targeting computers- and a lift along the outer wall provides access to the cannon room on the floor above.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The vulnerability of X-Corps bases to an assault has always been a major concern and the Missile Defense Array was conceived as an initial protection measure. If our activity is discovered to be sufficiently succesful in fulfilling our goals, it is likely that our bases would become prime targets for retaliatory strikes.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Corps engineers have improved on existing missile defense technologies to bring about the advanced Missile Defense Array based on the veteran 'Rapier' SAM system, currently used by major world military organizations. While Missile Defense Array is the first facility to be employed in our active defense strategy, unfortunately, our initial knowledge do not allow us to effectively estimate the possibility of an succesful attack on our bases. Thus, increasing the number of defensive weapons through construction of multiple defense facilites can improve our ability to repel such assaults.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Missile Defense Array is relatively fast to construct, cheap to install and maintain and provides some security against an invasion. The facility is build on a square area with the length of 15 meters and it contains a control room connected to an accurate, though very short-range, microwave radar, two rotatory missile racks, each containing 8 ready-to-launch 'Rapier' missiles, and storage for a generous supply of missiles delivered through an automatic loading system. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>In case of an impending assault, the roof quickly slides back to allow lifting of the rotatory racks, which start locking on the incoming targets with the help of an array of continuous low power lasers. Inside the control room, protected by steel blast doors, our defensive operators can remotely assist by adjusting the missile trajectories when the tracking devices alone are unable to lock onto difficult targets due to excessive speeds or unusual emissions spectra. Microwave radar signals are continually analyzed by photomolecular supercomputers, enabling fast access to vital information about the target- its shape, size, and velocity- all with a precision of mere centimeters, giving our defenses a significant boost in accuracy. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>While Missile Defense Array design may later be improved upon with newer technologies, this facility is our first active defense against enemy assaults. Additionally, it instills a relative sense of security among base inhabitants.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>With the problem of UFOs attempting to dock with X-Corps bases becoming an increasing threat, more research has been devoted to the problem. An idea set forward by a young scientist was to adapt Alien plasma weaponry, more specifically, the plasma cannon technology, to make a defensive version of it. Plasma cannons are a recent breakthrough by our scientists, and have been found to be suitable for use in base defense.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The mechanism used in our other plasma weapons has been sized up many times and is now used to power multiple cannons at once. When aimed at the target, the cannons lock in a specific attack pattern to match the target.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>One problem encountered by our scientists was the large amounts of plasma-gel and heavy water required, both of which are very hard to obtain. We have managed to secure regular sources of uranium and heavy water, but we must still obtain the Xenium-122 from alien ships if we are to continue using plasma weapons on this scale.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>As the initial blueprints for our underground base were being designed, it dawned on us that the layout of our storage facility was going to be critical. Furthermore, as the demand for extra space kept increasing exponentially, the initial warehouse designs were deemed highly inefficient. We could not effectively manage the variety and quantity of items we were going to store and withstand the possible shock of a military assault at the same time.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Thus, a prototype Storage and Retrieval system was developed, using a semi-automatic racking mechanism operated by a number of highly trained apothecaries. The end result proved a success and a facility complex was designed to complement it.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The General Storage Facility, as it is modestly named, is capable of storing a high amount of items within its 225m2 while still able to retrieve them lightning fast. The G.S.F. sports solid concrete walls reaching 5 meters in height, double roller doors, and an advanced fire protection system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Common or lightweight items are usually stored in the lower shelves, while the heavier and more valuable items are stored in blast proof containers that are suspended from the ceiling and accessed using a computerized lift that maneuvers by way of tracks built into the ceiling. In addition to the semi-automatic mechanisms, the warehouse is also equipped with more mundane retrieval means such as forklifts and ladders. This mixed configuration has proved to be the best and most secure way for managing our inventory.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Initial observations of Alien creatures conducted by military operatives point to the fact that these beings possess very different physiologies among themselves, and very different from ours as well. Standard brigs are highly inadequate to maintain the extraterrestrials alive. It has become apparent that we need a new kind of prison; one that can effectively contain all kinds of life forms while being able to manipulate the internal environment. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>To this end, we have designed the MK III "Alkatraz" Containment Chamber which improved on previous designs that did not account for proper atmospheric conditions or provide effective containment for certain Alien species.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Each Alkatraz chamber has 0.5m thick concrete walls that are reinforced with electromagnetic conductors and barriers that severely disrupt any form of known perception and can withstand several tons of force.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The advanced configuration of the environmental control allows us to create any kind of atmosphere/pressure that we need. Usually the environment is modified in such a way as to keep the specimen in a sedated condition. We can, however, modify it to become lethal, as a security measure.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The chamber also sports advanced automated security and surveillance measures that monitor the specimen within and have very delicate warning procedures that are triggered automatically over any sudden change in behavior.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The airlock-style doors are made from totally secure materials and can only open with a combination of codes and keycards. Three unauthorized tries for access or a breach in the chamber walls result in the instant termination of the contained specimen and activation of base alarms.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Finally, the cell is equipped with a small backup generator system to power the security systems.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Alien Containment Facility includes 10 Alkatraz chambers, as well as a surveillance room.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>As the war continues, our technicians are hard-pressed to find more efficient and effective methods of defending our bases. The best way to do this is considered to be shooting down attacking UFOs before they can land and jeopardize the lives and equipment inside our installations. Unfortunately, our current defensive systems are, while effective against smaller UFOs, incapable of destroying or incapacitating larger attackers. While examining alien Gravity Distortion Drone technology, we have now developed what we consider the ultimate base defense system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Gravitational Active Interception Armament (GAIA) Defense Module is a type of gravity distortion technology specially adapted to its use as a stationary surface-to-air weapon. This weapon is capable of hitting and blasting through the hulls of the toughest ships. Even the largest UFOs can be brought down with these lethal tools, although it might still take more than one of these modules.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The GAIA Defense Module, like the craft weapon we developed using the same technology, is propelled by a gravity field. Unlike the previous gravity distortion weapons, however, the field is not generated by the projectile itself. Instead, this is achieved by an array of modified Xenium Reactors supplemented by conventional energy supply. This external energy input through advanced fuel cells and high-charge capacitors ensures a minimum Xenium need for the propulsion systems. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, the capacitors cannot always be maintained in a charged state, for technical reasons. This reduces the rate of fire of the Module, because once a UFO has been detected, the systems have to be powered up first. Due to the high effectiveness of the GAIA Defense, however, this is considered a fair trade for the minimal Xenium use.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The projectile itself is capable of passively re-configuring the gravity field. In effect, it is the principle of the Gravity Distortion Launcher/Drone system turned inside-out.  Because it is several times larger than the GAIA Missile developed as a craft weapon, it accomodates all necessary sensory and computational equipment to ensure a near-perfect target tracking.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Xenium use of the system is further reduced by the increased physical dimensions of the shell, which allows us to exploit an effect we stumbled upon while trying to optimize the efficiency of Xenium reactions. Instead of destabilising an entire Xenium Reactor to create the desired destructive effect, a minute amount of Xenium is placed in a miniature z-pinch device surrounded by high-charge capacitors. The Xenium's gravitational and magnetic effects assist the z-pinch in plasma compression, with catastrophic results. Only microseconds after activation of the system, the entire projectile collapses into the conversion reaction, creating a massive plasma surge. While we haven't been able to test it, and are also quite reluctant to do so given the chance, computer simulations suggest that this reaction is in fact enhanced in the presence of strong gravity fields such as those created by UFOs' Xenium Reactors.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With the GAIA Base Defense Module, we should be able to efficiently defend ourselves against attacking UFOs.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>With recent advances in psionic technology, a vast array of new applications is becoming available. The latest of these is the Neural Shielding Facility, designed in response to the frightening realization that Aliens may possess the ability to pinpoint the location of our bases by thought patterns alone.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Contemporary investigation in the field of psionics has uncovered the sophistication of the Aliens' methods: to a degree, they appear to be able to determine the content of human thought patterns over a distance of a few hundred kilometers. X-Corps bases, even with relatively few people, can be detected, perhaps through some typical brain-waves involuntarily induced by X-Corps basic training, or by the fact that all personnel exude defiance towards the Alien incursion instead of the usual terror exhibited by civilian populations. After identifying this gaping hole in X-Corps base security, we re-examined our previous research into Psionic Theory for a technique to mask these waves.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The newly developed Neural Shielding Facility harnesses a large array of subunits containing the same special enzymes found in the Psionic Amplifier to establish a cancellation grid. Although it does not block brain-waves entirely, as the name implies, it dampens them through destructive interference. This facility consists of two large circular elements coupled to a supercomputer utilizing a network of highly specialized surface acoustic wave chips. The lower component is a sensory array which receives the psionic waves propagating from within its detection limit. After analysis, the upper part subsequently emits a cancelling waveform, greatly reducing the original signal's amplitude. Due to its enormous power consumption, the facility is equipped with an energy system located in the lower floor of the module. According to our calculations, masking the Psionic footprint of our bases should significantly decrease the probability of detection by enemy forces.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Supplemental energy requirements and complexity of the psionic transceiver are the primary reasons for the significant cost of building the Neural Shielding Facility. At the same time, the delicate technology involved requires constant technical service, resulting in high maintenance costs. The tactical advantage of secrecy cannot be taken lightly as remaining concealed from Alien forces reduces the likelihood of costly base attacks. Due to the enormous energy and maintenance costs, building more than one shielding facility would not be cost efficient. In addition, there would be no appreciable change in the machine's overall effectiveness.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Short Range NEUDAR is a neutrino based detection system that currently is the only method of detecting UFOs reliably. X-Corps is the first military force to implement the use of NEUDARs, and as such, is the only combat force with the ability to effectively detect and counter the alien invaders.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>&lt;insert Fluffie!&gt;</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Records have shown that UFOs have means of evading detection by conventional radars, probrably due to the materials and construction of the alien crafts. As result, when the UFO incursions increased both in hostility as well as frequency, it proved important to develop an effective means of detection.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>During a documented UFO sighting in Japan, the Kamiokande II neutrino detector recorded an unprecedented increase in neutrino detection and when the scientists calculated the source of the neutrinos, they discovered that the source corresponded with the position of the UFO. Futher research into this phenomena revealed that many neutrino detectors recorded increased rates of neutrino detection during time periods that corresponded with a roughly quarter of all UFO sightings reported. This immediately triggered a renewed interest in the development of a neutrino detection array, this time specifically designed to triangulate and track UFOs.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Short Range Neutrino Detection Array(NEUDAR) consists of three large underground tanks filled with pure water and lined with extremely sensitive light sensors. When highly charged neutrinos enter the individual tanks, they give of bursts of lights in a cone. By detecting the cones of light, the direction from which the neutrinos originated from can then be calculated by a cluster of computer. Then, by combining data from the three tanks, the position of the source can then be triangulated. While there is no maximum range at which neutrinos can be detected, the number of neutrinos from any one source that can be detected by the NEUDAR decreases exponentially as the distance increases. As such, the NEUDAR system is limited by the range at which neutrino emitted by UFOs fade into the background radiation.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A smaller variation of the neutrino detector, designed with a aluminium oxide orb six inches in diameter encapsulated with photosensitive CCD was developed for use with aircrafts and missles inorder to detect and intercept UFOs. While less sensitive and accurate than ground based NUEDARs, the ALOX based system, when combined with Foward-Looking InfraRed(FLIR) cameras, provide our aircrafts with the ability to track the alien crafts.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The construction of additional NEUDARs can increase the sensitivity of the entire NEUDAR network as a whole as well as speed up the triangulation of the source. This is because the addition of tanks not only increases the chances of detecting a neutrino burst, but also provide additional directional data besides being used to the calculation of the source, but also as a source of data verification.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to the fact that NEUDARs are located underground and are based on passive detection, they prove to be undetectable to external sources. This is a valuble asset as it will prevent the alien invaders from locating our bases with ease. A design for large NEUDARs has been completed recently and has both improved detection rates as well as increased detection range.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Long Range Neudar Facility</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Long Range NEUDAR is a recently developed larger and more advanced version of the Short Range Neudar that has both better detection range and detection rate through the use of CCDs and an advanced supercomputer. Multiple NEUDARs can improve the detection rate of UFOs that are within range. We recommend that at least one Long Range NEUDAR be built at every base.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When the prototype NEUDAR system was first activated, it immediately detected dozens of UFOs in the surrounding areas. However, scrambled fighters from nearby airbases did not encouter any unidentified crafts at any of the reported locations. Upon investigation, it was discovered that many of the false readings were caused by the background radiation. While an algorithim later was developed to filter out the background radiation, there was still enough static to limit the range of the NEUDAR system. In an effort to increase detection range, developement of a long range neutrino detection array was initiated.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The result of the project, the Long Range NEUDAR, not only fulfilled the requirement of better detection range, but also had better rate of detection. However, due to the fact that the Long Range NEUDAR required an extremely long time to setup compared to the Short Range NEUDAR, it was deemed that Short Range NEUDARs were necessary as to provide new bases with the ability to provide NEUDAR coverage while the long range version is under construction.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Long Range Neutrino Detection Array (NEUDAR), like the Short Range NEUDAR, consists of three large, underground tanks filled with pure water. However, these three tanks are twenty percent larger than their counterparts in the smaller NUEDAR and use an extremely sensitive layer of Charged-Couple Devices (CCDs) that enable the large Neudar to collect very precise data regarding the neutrinos that it detects. This, combined with the use of the new HELIX III supercomputer and advanced filtering algorithms, provides the Long Range NUEDAR the ability to reduce the effects of background radiation interference, enabling the detection of UFOs outside the range of the Short Range NEUDAR. The processing power of the HELIX III supercomputer also reduces the time required to triangulate a neutrino source, increasing the rate at which neutrino sources can be pinpoint and verified.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, the CCDs used in the construction of the detector tanks are not only much more expensive than the light sensors used in the smaller NEUDAR, they also have a tendency to burn out. As such, they have to be replaced regularly, resulting in higher maintenance costs. The use of a HELIX III supercomputer also adds considerably to the expense of the Long Range NEUDAR system. Nevertheless, the detection rates and range of the larger system means that it is well worth the extra cost and time required to build it.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The construction of additional NEUDARs can increase the sensitivity of the entire network as a whole as well as speed up the triangulation of the source. This is because the addition of tanks not only increases the chances of detecting a neutrino burst, but also provides additional directional data not only for use in the calculation of the source, but also as a source of data verification.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to the fact that NEUDARs are located underground and are based on passive detection, they prove to be undetectable to external sources. This is a valuable asset as it will prevent the alien invaders from locating our bases with ease.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>We have long suspected that the Aliens used tachyon-based communications. Unfortunately, due to the faster than light nature of tachyons, we were unable to design detection systems that triangulate the positions of the UFOs based on their communications. However, with data recently obtained by Section 9 (Interrogations), we are now capable of decoding their transmissions. Nevertheless, due to difficulty to understand the Aliens’ language, we can only obtain data regarding the speed, heading, and type of UFO, as well as the race of the crew and their mission profile.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>”Rule 69: The Tachyon Emissions Detector is not to be used to send text messages to the Aliens.”</paragraph>
        <bullet> Excerpt from ‘100 things Tommy can’t do in X-Corps’</bullet>
        <paragraph>Generally, tachyon emitters as well as receivers are a standard part of all designs, from the various scouts to the larger classes of UFOs. Interestingly, the tachyon emitters are not only connected to the communications console, but are also intricately linked to the navigation and propulsion systems, and in the larger classes of UFOs, overbuilt for the task of communications.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Tachyons have been theorized to be the possible carriers for Faster-Than-Light (FTL), or truly instantaneous, communications. Unfortunately, that which makes it so attractive for FTL communications also makes it hard to use, that is to say, technology to detect tachyons at FTL speeds have so far eluded researchers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, the Alien invaders not only brought their advanced weapon technology to our planet, but also their tachyon based FTL communications system. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the tachyon detection system can easily be replicated using Human technology now that our researchers have had a chance to reverse engineer a recovered comms system, the understanding of the Aliens transmissions proved otherwise.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to its very nature, tachyon-based communication systems are also heavily quantum-based, and as a result, have built-in quantum encryption. The tachyon emissions are generated by using a series of quantum particles, and in order to receive the transmissions, the exact states of all the quantum particles used in the emitter must be known before hand. Due to the ability of a single quantum particle to exist in eight states simultaneously, as well as not knowing the exact number of quantum particles used by the Aliens when they transmit, have left us with a very cheap, very easy to reproduce and very high tech, faster than light radio, with nothing to listen to.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Fortunately, recent intelligence obtained by Section 9 of the X-Corps Research Division has provided us to the key to intercepting Alien transmissions. Unfortunately, partially due to the fact that the Aliens do not use a common language, efforts by our best linguists have so far been unable to translate their transmissions. The fact that they do not use a common language lead us to suspect that there may be a telepathic part to the transmissions, and even though it is tempting to uncover and implement that as well, the risks of unintentionally revealing ourselves outnumber the advantages of understanding the Aliens. However, based on the language used, we are able to identify the species of the UFO's crew. Also, we have been able to decode information from the header of the transmissions which contain data regarding the type of UFO, its position and heading, as well as mission profile.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Nevertheless, there is still one piece of the puzzle still missing. The fact that the tachyon emitters are closely linked to the navigation and propulsion systems is far more complex than needs to be, yet even with the tachyon emitters removed, both navigations and propulsions systems still function without any sort of instability. As such, we suspect that the tachyon emitters may only be needed for some sort of functions that do not occur during normal flight. This combined with the fact that it is the Navigator Aliens that have the detailed knowledge required to use the tachyon communications system hint that the tachyon emitters may very well play a role in the Aliens’ supposed FTL travel capability. Unfortunately, we currently do not have enough detailed information on hand to do more than speculate.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>During the research and testing of the large gravity engines of the XC-33 Vengeance, our scientists made a startling discovery. They found that the large engines were able to control gravity waves for an incredible distance, greater than ever believed possible. The Vengeance’s engines were capable of generating and controlling a gravity field several kilometers away from the craft, with no known limit. In theory, a large enough land-based Xenium-based engine could control gravity around an X-Corps facility, and protect it from attack.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The "Grav shield", as it's come to be called, was originally proposed to protect X-Corps facilities from possible Alien bombardment. Research into the incredible materials at the Aliens’ disposal has cast a dark shadow over the safety of our underground facilities. If the Aliens were to attempt to make use of a Xenium bomb, they could theoretically create explosions with power greater than that of a Hydrogen bomb. Our underground facilities would not be able to hold against such an attack. The original Grav shield design would deflect these "fusion bombs", and use gravity waves to keep the base integrity intact. However, research into this design was put on hold, as testing has shown that an extremely powerful field would be required to repel a device of any size, and creating such a complicated and massive device was completely beyond our reach.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This has led to a redesign of the Grav shield. A gigantic specialized gravity engine is constructed within a 100m2 facility. It is capable of generating a very powerful and very extensive gravity disturbance, resulting in a minimal net gravity, which is directed at the incoming target. This field interferes with the Alien propulsion systems, causing them to produce a fraction of their power. As well, considerable pilot control and engine resources are required to resist the powerful gravitational forces; this reduces the incoming target's speed logarithmically, slowing it to a fraction of its initial speed. This will allow our slower base defenses to fire at the target with a vastly increased chance to hit, and will allow ample time to rearm the defenses to fire a second time. The intelligent targeting computers lock out undesirable targets for these gravity waves, such as rural areas, or the center of an X-Corps facility.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, controlling such a large engine and keeping it stable stretches the limits of even the best of our Xenium-based engines. The effect of having extra Grav shield facilities active would be catastrophic, as the gravity wave interference that two engines would cause to each other will make them impossible to control. The result would send uncontrollable and extremely destructive gravity waves everywhere, capable of crushing an X-Corps base. We have built in internal failsafe devices to shut down the field as soon as the second wave of defenses are fired, but be advised, that only one Grav shield facility can be safely active within an X-Corps base.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As a side note, the tidal forces of the field also cause considerable water condensation in the air. This has led independent contractors of the funding nations to pursue possible weather control technologies using this device.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Species/Grey</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Grey is a physically weak but highly intelligent lifeform. It is as vulnerable and susceptible to injury as humans are, if not more so, but their natural psionic abilities make their battle formations, like their society as a whole, incredibly effective.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Greys are relatively easy to keep alive in containment due to their small size and minimal needs. Their small bodies require very little nutrition, which can be easily provided through a series of injections directly into their bloodstream. Their physiology seems to be well-suited for our planet, though they prefer moist, warmer climates. They are also almost completely harmless and passive when unarmed and separated from their chain of command and fellow Greys. Hence, they are not violent or dangerous captives, facilitating close examination and requiring little advanced containment equipment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Grey’s large eyes allow it to see well in the dark, but strangely, light reflects off their opaque corneas instead of their retinas like in nocturnal terrestrial life. Its sense of hearing is nonexistent; it can only feel loud sounds by their vibrations since it lacks appropriate hearing organs. This creature does not communicate by sound; we have recorded their sporadic screeching noises, but they seem to be of little consequence.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>These Aliens have an extremely developed brain resulting in the oddly shaped cranium that is so characteristic of them. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>We are now able to confirm that Greys communicate through a basic form of telepathy. Without advanced psionic amplification equipment, this is limited, much like oral communication, in terms of range and potency. Standard Grey communication seems to involve the exchange of concepts and ideas. However, the speed of indirect telepathic communication provides a quasi–hive mind setup, where each Grey acts as a node and transmits information to the next Grey in a psionic communication network of some sorts. On a more disconcerting note, personnel working in the vicinity of captive Greys have reported occasional impulses to assist the captive. While there have been no incidents so far, our researchers theorize that perhaps with training or external aids, these creatures might be able to exert mental control over other beings. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>A study of these Alien creatures shows that they are startlingly ill-adapted to life. They are unable to digest even the simplest liquid foods, let alone solid aliments, and there are no signs of designated liquid or solid waste excretion systems, nor any signs of reproductive organs. The Greys are effectively unable to survive in the wilderness unsupported. Had our scientists not come up with the idea of using IV drips and dialysis machines, we would not have been capable of keeping captive Greys alive for extended periods of time. All of this suggests that either the Greys are a species of disposable drones or one whose survival is entirely dependent on technology in order to both ingest nutrients and perpetuate their race through artificial means. Given the evidence of the Greys’ highly organized hierarchy, we believe that the Grey society is too intricate for mere drones, and we speculate that the limited functionality of Grey physiology may be a result of genetic tampering.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to the Greys’ telepathic ability, its society indeed behaves as an amazingly efficient hive mentality with a total lack of emotion. This efficiency is accentuated by their profound sense of logic; individual Grey designations seem to be based on a binary sequence. As an example of their hierarchical coordination, when confronted by a potential threat, these creatures will change behavior rapidly to preserve itself or defend fellow Greys, either using its psionic abilities against nearby threats, or adopting a unified “fight or flight” response in conjunction with other Greys, where one individual assumes the role of a temporary controller or commander. Hence, these creatures are able to form, dissolve, and adapt command chains instantly. We still, however, believe there is group of permanent high-ranking Greys operating from bases here on Earth.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As part of the Alien threat, Greys usually function as scouts and observers due to their intelligence, large capacity for science and technology, efficient communication network, and incredible ocular acuity. The similarities between the physical appearance of Greys and the descriptions given by victims of Alien abductions lead us to believe that these Aliens are highly active in experimental research into the human genetic structure, and we should be wary of the results of their progress into inductive genetic mutation and cloning technologies.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Operating primarily on lightly armed research vessels, they should be considered a considerable threat to any operation.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The Grey body structure is relatively simple, possessing almost all organ systems and tissue types seen in higher tetrapods today. Most of these systems, however, seem to have atrophied, save for the incredibly advanced brain. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The integument of the Grey body appears almost amphibious in nature, possessing large amounts of mucous-secreting glands that keep their skin moist, enabling them to use their skin as a respiratory membrane. The skin between the fingers forms a small web-like structure, suggesting that these creatures are at least semi-aquatic in origin. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The muscular and skeletal structure present in the Greys is homologous to that of humans, with an axial skeleton supporting the central nervous system, muscles, and limbs. The skull is massive compared to that of humans, supported by a strong spinal column and a thin, but muscular neck. Most of the other muscles in the creature’s body, however, seem to have atrophied to varying degrees, proof of either a sudden, irreversible habitat change or genetic manipulation. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The mouth is toothless, and no structures for mastication exist. The esophagus is also vestigial and possesses very little muscle, making it impossible for Greys to ingest food orally. The remainder of the digestive system is extremely rudimentary, and no digestive glands were found, hinting at the artificial means by which these creatures acquire nutrition. Elimination of solid and liquid waste through means other than regurgitation or skin secretion appears impossible due to the absence of anal and urogenital passages, as well as the vestigial state of the kidneys. The characteristics of the Grey excretory and digestive systems leads to the conclusion that these creatures are dependent on highly processed nutrients supplied externally, probably through injection directly into their bloodstream.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The respiratory organs appear to be well-developed, and the presence of pharyngeal passages leading to two sac-like lungs similar to those found in amphibians further supports arguments that Greys were once amphibious, and probably inhabited wetlands or marshes. Vocal structures are absent, leaving the method of communication between these creatures to speculation. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>There are no signs of reproductive organs on this creature, but the shape and structure of pelvic girdle suggest adaptation to birthing young. This suggests that the Greys at one time were a virile species capable of reproduction, leaving the reasons for their sterility as a possible product of genetic tampering. From this information, our Research Division has concluded that the Greys reproduce in one of two ways, in a manner resembling that of bees belonging to the Hymenoptera family, with an egg-laying queen creature being the source of the entire Grey species, or solely through artificial means such as cloning. Due to the 99.99% genetic similarity found in our analyses of various Grey specimens, the latter method is much more likely.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of these Aliens’ anatomy is their brain structure. This large structure possesses more than twice the number neurons and glial cells found in a single human brain, hinting at the incredible cerebral capacity of these creatures. Further dissection of the brain revealed a disproportionately large frontal lobe, the seat of communicative skills. This finding, combined with the absence of vocal structures, has led some of our scientists theorize that Greys communicate through some sort of telepathic link, but the veracity of this claim has yet to be proven.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Species/Morlock</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The most important information collected from the field reports about 'Morlocks' is their great prowess in battle. They seem able to shrug off major damage without a care, as if bullets were no more of a danger to them than drops of rain. Those operatives who have escaped a Morlock attack claim that these Aliens can rip a grown man's arm clean off and smash through locked doors without so much as breaking a sweat.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Despite their ape-like appearance, they are quite intelligent and cunning on the battlefield. The quality of their tactics and maneuvers rival those of the X-Corps elite soldiers. However, outside the battlefield, the situation is totally different. While in captivity, Morlocks do little more than rest and train, while exhibiting little to no social activity not related to warfare. It seems that if these creatures ever had a civilization of their own, it is totally gone now. They resemble war-machines rather than a sentient species.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After long periods of consciousness within the base, the Morlock psyche begins to show signs of acute deterioration. It seems as if these creatures were "programmed" to receive commands from their masters from time to time. If no commands are received (which are speculated to be issued psionically) the Morlock enters a state of coma, which invariably leads the creature to its death; an effective method of control over such a powerful minion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The subject does not appear to know much about its home-world, the location being completely unknown to it, it only knows (or is only willing to share) about the landscapes and general aspects of its life. Apparently its home-world is a harsh, yet beautiful place, at least according to Morlock beauty standards. The Morlocks, despite being the only sentient species on the planet, are not on the top of the food chain. This led to a highly aggressive civilization of hunters-warriors. The current status of their home-world is unknown to them, or so the questioned creature claims. The interrogation has provided us with small and vague clues that the planet remains outside the main "Star-Spawn" forces reach, thus we can speculate that there are Morlocks out there that could be reasoned with, excluding the necessity of a loaded rifle and a handful of grenades as the only possible way.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Morlocks wear a specially crafted environment suit, a design apparently originally made by the Morlocks themselves to survive the first faltering steps into the void of space. The suit, greatly improved by the Star-Spawn's technology, has a powerful exoskeleton which offers superior protection while enhancing the strength and speed of the wearer. The exoskeleton also features a respirator mask which is removable to allow the Morlocks to satiate their natural need of meat and re-hydration.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Morlocks are a species of pack-hunting predators. The hunt has, or rather has had, great social and religious meaning in their society. Apparently they hunted their prey without weapons and ate the flesh raw. While the subject refused to reveal any more information on the Morlock society, he or she or it did tell us how they are "optimized" for battlefield and to serve the "Star-Spawn".</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The life of a Morlock warrior was dictated by a code of honor. The creatures started to adapt to this code from a very young age. Such things as fleeing the battlefield without the order of withdrawal were seen as capital crimes and were severely punished. The penalty was usually death; however, it was expected to be performed by the code breaker itself and only if it was willing to do so. But those who chose not to perform the ritual suicide were damned to a life of outcast. This aspect of the Morlock life is inexistence nowadays, in the Alien forces there are no outcasts; those found inadequate to perform its duties in the Alien horde are executed without hesitation.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A Morlock warrior's status was shown by the amount of trophies it has collected from enemies. Trophies are usually a part of the enemy's body; bones are favored due to the fact that they do not decay. Bone trophies are also usually crafted into luxury items, weapons or armor. For example, a skull might be made into a ritual mask and leg bones into handles for weapons, fingers into jewelry, etc.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is possible that the Morlock society which remains in their home planet still fits to this description.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is clear even from a quick observation that the Morlocks have no reproductive organs. These, the creature reveals, are removed; and while technically it could be called surgically, it is apparent that no such carefulness is given to the operation. The operation takes place in the Morlocks' puberty and is carried out without any anesthetics. The Star-Spawn, it seems, wish the operation to show the Morlocks their place. The operation is performed by Medics from other species, the assignment to castrate the Morlocks, however, is used as a punishment for the medical troops and torturing the Morlocks in a fit of anger is not unheard of. Shortly after a Morlock is mutilated, psionics step in to use the shock and trauma caused by the procedure to strip the creature in question of its independence. While this could easily be done while the Morlock is still an infant, it would lead to unwanted lack of initiative and passiveness.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The subject has told us one of the many legends that the Morlocks apparently pass along by oral tradition. Varying from legend to legend, the "Star-Spawn" Aliens are portrayed either as benevolent god or as malicious demon though in a few legends the portrait of the Alien "Star-Spawn" is more accurate, as its members are not gods, but slavers from beyond. Any attempts to question the creature of the true nature of the so-called "Star-Spawn" always resulted in an incessant repetition of cryptic Morlock legends, and if pressed into providing more information, the subject entered a catatonic state, muttering incoherent cryptic phrases.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Also notable about the Morlocks is the fact that in their society (or the remnants of it) there is no discrimination between sexes. Women fight along side the men. It is left to speculation whether this equality was forcefully added later by the Star-Spawn or is an original aspect of Morlock civilization.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Right from the start, it is clear that the “armor” Morlocks carry is crafted upon their bodies and is irremovable without drastic surgical procedures. The suit, in fact, acts as a second armored skin to the Morlocks, complete with a second pair ears and eyes. The sensory attachments are both external electronic sensors and internal cybernetic implants, working together in an effective symbiosis. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Further study of the Morlock digestive system gives us solid proof that they are carnivorous and need to ingest fresh raw meat frequently to stay healthy. It is suggested that they may have a quick metabolism in order to facilitate rapid recovery from wounds in battle. The specimen is conspicuously lean with less than 3% of its body mass used in adipose tissues. Additional research can determine if this slightly malnourished specimen is the exception or the norm. It could be that the Star-Spawn cut the rations while the troops are in transport, or maybe those who are less effective in the field receive less food. Perhaps the leaders might simply hoard most of the food to themselves. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Morlock bone-structure appears to be nano-mechanically reinforced to increase agility, hardness and to reduce stress on the skeleton. Small alterations have been noticed in the muscular tissue of the Morlocks, but apparently they are almost naturally strong. In fact, with their reinforced bones, the Morlocks can easily lift approximately twice their own body weight without any ill effects. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Morlock genome seems void of any tampering, or at least none that our present understanding in genetic engineering can determine. The Morlock body however, has been drastically altered by means of cybernetic implants. Ranging from senses to internal organs, little of the Morlock body remains unmodified. The cardiovascular system, for instance, relies entirely upon a cybernetic heart, which is less vulnerable to small arms fire than an organic heart and allows blood to flow more efficiently. The digestive and respiratory systems have been augmented to withstand extreme environments. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>In summary, the Morlock alterations have made an already formidable opponent a superb fighting machine capable of operation in almost any conceivable scenario. In fact, every cybernetic implant and surgical modification seems to have been designed in such a way as to maximize fighting capability. These creatures are clearly the shock troopers for the Alien horde.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Species/Satyrian</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Satyrian is a relatively dangerous Alien that can hover and move through the air, gaining a great tactical advantage. It is recommended that all X-Corps agents stay alert and keep an eye on the skies during a confirmed Satyrian sighting.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This unusual creature seems to be, partially at least, an artificial construct. Its reflexes are very quick and it seems to have sharp visual acuity, but only rudimentary senses of touch and taste. The Satyrian’s language consists of a complex mixture of grunts, moans and sub vocal sounds. It shows a good mechanical aptitude, able to quickly disassemble and reassemble simple devices it has, presumably, never been exposed to before. It also showed great interest in the sub vocal microphone that was used to capture a sample of its speech patterns, as well as the more invasive medical instruments that were used in the physical examination. Also, the Satyrian exhibited a sadistic liking of performing invasive surgery, as evidenced by the unfortunate and brutal death of Dr. Smith.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While it is obvious that the Satyrian could not have evolved naturally into its current state, there are still clues that indicate what the home world of this bizarre Alien may have been like. Due to the oversized claws, extended horns, and remnants of the jaw structure of the Satyrian, it can be assumed that it was a pronounced predator. The hands are not structured to be used as paws, so it can be concluded that the Satyrian evolved as a bipedal hunter, probably in a region of low undergrowth, perhaps plains or light forests. Also the lightweight construction of the bones and organs (what few have not been replaced by the life support/levitation device) indicates that the home world of this Alien had lower gravity than our planet’s.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is unknown whether the cybernetic implant was developed by the Satyrian species or by one of the other Alien species, however, given their natural aptitude with machines; it would not be surprising if this race was cybernetic before its alliance with the other Alien races. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>While detailed knowledge of the Satyrian society is not possible without further advances in communication between our race and theirs, it is apparent from the battle reports that the Satyrians, while having a definite hierarchy, seem to operate fairly independently of each other during a mission. This also lends credence to the theory of their evolution from solitary predators. It appears that most of the Satyrians view their assignments as personal leave to enjoy themselves. They seem to derive great pleasure from using their flying abilities to surprise and terrify their “prey”. Satyrians will often attempt brute force fusions of handy Carth technology with civilians. They seem especially likely to attempt these horrific experiments on those individuals that appear weakest or that are being obviously protected by others during abductions. While they do not seem interested in the after effects of these mutilations, they do seem to derive great pleasure from the reactions of other captives to these operations.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>This unusual specimen provided many fascinating observances on advanced cybernetic implants. The creature is extremely lightweight, yet strong, with bones and joints able to withstand tremendous pressures and crushing weights. The Alien’s skeletal structure is made of a complex carbon lattice in a honeycomb configuration similar to a bird's. This construction has resulted in a skeletal structure that is lightweight while, at the same time, durable: bones and joints have been proven extremely resistant to breaking and fractures. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The skin is extremely thin and oddly perforated by small “gills”, allowing oxygen absorption directly from the atmosphere. This translucent epidermis is what gives the Satyrian its white-pinkish color. This system does not function at peak efficiency on Earth due to its increased gravity in comparison to the one this creature seems best suited for; this causes the Satyrian’s veins to expand and become more visible, and its skin to become pale. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Its musculature is very tightly woven bundles of muscle fiber interlaced with Alien Composites fibers. The Composite fibers appear to bolster the strength of the tendons and ligaments, as well as the binding of the limbs at the joints. The arrangement of the musculature appears consistent with terran norms for high-speed runners; therefore the Satyrian was likely to be extremely quick even before the addition of the levitation device. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The major organs have been removed and replaced with a complex life support/levitation device. There are several other cybernetic interfaces that serve unknown functions. The few biological organs are believed to relate to purification of the blood/oxygen mix, help maintain balance and equilibrium during high speed maneuvers, and perform digestion.  This intense filtration system would probably render the Satyrian immune to smoke and gas inhalation effects.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>	</paragraph>
        <paragraph>There is ample evidence of severe surgical trauma and general system deterioration. It is the hypothesis of the Research Division that the Alien’s system, optimized as it is for a low G environment, suffers severe deterioration under the increased pressures of earth. Without the unique skeletal structure and cybernetic reinforcements of the major muscle masses, the Satyrian would most likely be crushed under its own weight on Earth. This system deterioration leads to the necessary replacement of vital organs on a semi-regular basis. How the Satyrian can withstand the trauma of these operations is unknown, though the progressive nervous system damage probably renders the Satyrian almost completely insensitive to pain.   </paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>Fortunately for X-Corps personnel, the cybernetic organs are considerably more fragile than its organic counterparts, especially at the connection points with the rest of the system. This renders the Satyrian very susceptible to internal damage.  </paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Vipers are one of the more unsettling of the various invading Alien species. Their eerie similarity to terrestrial rattlesnakes evokes a common fear among all personnel. Indeed, early field reports suggested that this might have been a creature genetically engineered from Earthly fauna, grown to enormous size and grafted with arms. However, these creatures are a completely new Alien species; sentient beings with the remnants of what must have been an amazing culture. Our initial interrogations have given us the name of the Viper home world, Sshi-yii, and a general idea of its location. From the subject's description, we suspect that this world is actually a moon of one of the earliest extra solar planets that have been discovered. It is known to astronomers as HD-70642 b, orbiting a type G5 star, approximately 29 parsecs from Earth. More detailed information of this world is unknown to us at this point.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Vipers are a carnivorous species, able to eat only freshly killed meat. They appear to be comfortable on land, but prefer shallow water, suggesting a swamp-based origin. In keeping with their generally reptilian appearance, a Viper's body is covered in thousands of pentagonal scales, except for the head. Eleven large plates of bone-reinforced scales protect the head itself. These scales provide excellent natural armoring of vital areas, and allow these Aliens to function in a wide variety of conditions. While sentient in its own right, the subject refers constantly to “the Master”, from whom all its kin take orders. From the context of these statements, we are sure that the subject does not merely refer to its own leaders, but a completely separate species that seems to be directing the Vipers’ incursions on our planet.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Viper species reproduces asexually, laying between thirty and fifty softball-sized eggs at a time in a frenzy of ovulation. The eggs are released into a common, water-filled gestational pit, where the soft jelly-like mucus that protects each egg can come in contact with another individual’s ovum. This contact allows for a transfer of genetic material between the different eggs, resulting in fertilization. Eggs cannot be fertilized by sibling ova. The soft covering requires that the eggs must remain immersed in water in their natural state. However, according to our current subject, the Vipers have developed a symbiotic relationship with creatures they call "Achidnas", using thier defensive secretions and providing a protected living enviroment in return. When in contact with these venomous secretions, the vulnerable covering of the Viper egg hardens, forming a tough leathery shell. The substance also apparently affects the fetuses to a genetic level, providing them with immunity to the Achidna venom. After an extended period of time (unfortunately, we are still unable to accurately translate time measurement), all viable eggs within a birthing pit hatch within brief period, and a feeding frenzy begins amongst the newborns. Out of several hundred fertilized eggs, only a dozen or so will survive the birth process. Once the hatching is complete, the birthing pit is opened to the Achidnas, who devour the shells, along with any unhatched eggs. The amniotic fluid clinging to the inner portion of the shell fragments contains a number of enzymes required by an Achidna's body to produce its venom.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Vipers we see today are the remnants of a once great species. Their civilization developed in a swampy temperate zone of Sshi-yii they call Ssth-Kr'th and spread across the entire planet. With their innate resistance to adverse conditions they built cities in every climate, from the blazing heat of their tropics, to the frozen poles.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Our dissection of this creature has led to many fascinating revelations. Beneath its tough, scaly skin, the Viper does not have myeloid tissue as we understand it. Instead, each major 'muscle' is actually a multi-chambered organ similar to the Human heart. Each ventricle contains a varying amount of thick fluid, and movement is achieved by a natural hydraulic action, with the fluid being pumped from one chamber of the 'muscle' to another. This hydrodynamic movement is very efficient, giving a Viper great speed and agility.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Viper skeletal structure is significantly less complex than the Human skeleton, containing only 123 bones. The skull is formed from a single bone, with a large cranial capacity. The jaw is actually composed by two parts, one on each side, with extensive musculature around the venom sacs. The shoulder area contains five bones forming a complex structure of anchors for the shoulder muscle organs. There is no actual joint connecting the arms to the shoulder as in terrestrial vertebrae; instead an interwoven series of muscle organs attaches the bones of the upper arm to the shoulder. This gives the creature the amazing flexibility reported by our operatives on the field. It can also allow a Viper to compress itself significantly, potentially fitting into narrow tunnels or pipes. Another major skeletal difference is the arms, with only a single heavy bone in the lower arm. All joints in the arm and hand are similar to the shoulder, differing only in size. The spine of the creature consists of over a hundred vertebrae, extending from the base of the skull to end of the tail, with each vertebra supporting a single cartilaginous rib that wraps entirely around the body. The costal structures completely enclose the body for almost the total length. The ribs in the last fifty centimeters of the body do not meet, instead leaving a flexible opening through which the eggs may pass.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Most of the internal organs of the specimen are analogous to terrestrial vertebrates, with oxygen absorption being handled by a trio of lung-like organs connected to the mouth. The only major difference is in the heart, a meter-long quartet of tubes extending from the chest into the tail. Apparently the very movement of the creature pumps its own heart. It seems this Alien would not survive complete unconsciousness for long.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The majority of the body and tail is taken up by the reproductive system. All specimens available have contained between forty and fifty eggs in a large protective sack. Quite often, these eggs are expelled from the body during the Alien's death throes. There do not seem to be any gender differences between any of the current specimens. Either there is a 'drone' of the species that fertilizes the eggs, or the creatures reproduce asexually. From the number of eggs in each specimen, it seems that this race would be a serious threat to our world should any colonies of the creatures allowed to establish themselves.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>With their alarming psionic skills and unnerving accuracy, the Cloaks are the one of the most dangerous foes X-Corps operatives have faced to date. Due to the brave and commendable performance of our Tac-Ops teams, we have been able to obtain a live specimen, which has allowed us to thoroughly study these creatures.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In observations of the Alien, its body appears to be fragile and weak, but apparently the creature’s psionic powers help boost its strength, senses, and even gift it with the ability to levitate, allowing the Alien to overcome this handicap. We are unsure as to how the creature can achieve its psionic abilities but through genetic modification and arduous conditioning from the earliest stages of life.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A mystery to us is why they wear insidious robes to cover their bodies. Currently there are three theories. One is that they wear them to intimidate their enemies and therefore gain a psychological advantage in battle. Another is that it somehow enhances their already powerful psionic abilities even more. The last theory states that the clothing is a form of ceremonial dress for some sort of cult or religion, but lack of pertinent data makes it impossible to corroborate this theory.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We were able to quickly gain an understanding of the way the Alien thinks due to the relative ease of communication. It seems that the Cloaks have little or no use for verbal communication, sending/reading telepathic messages instead. Due to this, all attempts of deceit failed and eventually it was deemed hazardous to communicate, for the Alien could easily take control of the scientific staff. All staff involved in the subject's interrogation described its demeanour as cool, logical, and calculating.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In the last planned interrogation, the Cloak took control of several members that were involved and we were given a spectacular, although unfortunate, demonstration of why these creatures are natural leaders. Using the staff under its control, the Alien showed outstanding resolve and insight in military tactics in its attempt to escape. After several minutes of intense fighting the specimen was subdued and all affected personnel quarantined until deemed safe to release. All contact with the creature was quickly terminated.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>From this and all the other information we have gained, it is most likely that the Cloaks are the ground force commanders of the Alien invasion. Even the lowest ranking Cloak commands many warriors from a wide variety of races and is trained to handle any situation in every possible way. Due to this, they pose an immeasurable threat to the existence of X-Corps and the human race, which makes finding an end to this war more urgent than ever before.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Alien creatures known as Cloaks are, undoubtedly, the fiercest enemies our troopers have faced on the battlefield. With this in mind, it was very surprising to discover that its physical appearance is one of amazingly weak disposition, being little more than skin and bones. Osseous, muscular and adipose tissue mass are incredibly inadequate for a creature of this size, leaving this species with little natural resistance to physical damage. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Their digestive system is extremely inefficient, the creatures require pre-digested food. Also, these Aliens do not possess a fully functional excretory system; rather the large intestine circulates back into the stomach making it impossible for the Alien to eat food from which it can not absorb all molecular components, having instead to feed with aliments containing only the determined proteins, glucose and lipids the creature needs to survive. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The cranial cavity accommodates a remarkably sophisticated brain; both the incredibly advanced cerebrum and abducens nerve are practically encased in an immense array of swelled cerebral arteries. Certain characteristics of the brain and parts of the central nervous system seem unnaturally developed and made more effective by some undetermined stimuli. With such an extensive neural network supporting the brain’s anatomic complexity, it is obvious that the Cloaks are capable of extraordinary psionic abilities and levels of physical manipulation through thought. As a result, scientists believe the most viable conclusion is that the Cloak is fruit of genetic manipulation and selective breeding. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The level of atrophy reached by the physical body suggests that the creature has evolved to its current form through constant dependency on psionic abilities. Their physical strength is so limited that they are unable to support the weight of their own bodies, forcing them to make constant use of these abilities in order to move. The cardiovascular system is woefully underdeveloped and not suited for our planet’s atmosphere, the atmospheric pressure is too much for it to handle and without Psionic assistance scientists conclude that the creature's death would result within 1 month due to intensive cardiovascular strain.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>These small, balloon-like creatures constitute a threat belied by their inoffensive appearance. With offensive abilities barely capable of injuring an unarmored agent, and only the most rudimentary of intelligences, these creatures are often ignored during battle in favor of most hostile targets. This leaves them to perform their true objective: devouring any corpses in the vicinity.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In essence, these apparently harmless organisms are a key logistical factor in the Alien life cycle. The acid they spit defensively has a much more important purpose: the digestion of dead flesh for consumption. Like the terrestrial fly, these fetal monstrosities float from corpse to corpse, regurgitating stomach acids to dissolve dead bodies, and then ingesting the resulting slime for nourishment. However, the feedings of the Ventriculant have a far darker purpose than mere sustenance.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The globulous flesh of the Ventriculant is primarily undifferentiated tissue, similar to a human fetus only a few weeks old. However, this tissue never differentiates while attached to the parent Ventriculant. Once removed from the parent, this tissue will rapidly convert to match the first cells it contacts. It will heal wounds without a scar, regenerate amputated limbs, and even repair or replace internal organs if surgically inserted. If DNA strands rather than fully developed cells are placed in contact with the tissue, an entire clone can be grown. The resulting clone will be the same chronological age as the original DNA donor. This then must be the source of the endless Alien hordes; no matter how many our agents kill, more will always be grown to take their place.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The only limit on cloning is the vast amounts of tissue required, approximately 250% of the new entity's final mass. The extra tissue provides nutrition for the clone as it matures. A sterile isolation chamber is required during this process to prevent contamination from external DNA. Should a cloning attempt be made without sufficient Ventriculant tissue, the result will always be non-viable. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This limitation of tissue mass is a flaw in the Alien plans that must be exploited. Every Ventriculant killed reduces their ability to produce more troops, as inert Ventriculant tissue no longer retains its cloning capabilities. Prevention of Alien resource raids serves the same purpose; without sufficient flesh for the Ventriculant to consume, less flesh can be grown for harvesting, and fewer Alien warriors cloned to terrorize our world.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Our dissection of this strange creature has been extremely rewarding. Its body seems to consist of nothing more than a highly efficient digestive system, a simple open circulatory system with a bare minimum of musculature and vast masses of pendulous tissue. A framework of small, interconnected spheres of Alien Composites were also found within the specimen, presumably the anti-gravity system that allows it to move</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Ventriculant’s digestive system is quite simple, limiting it solely to a diet of carrion.  Numerous small reservoirs of a highly corrosive digestive fluid are arranged around the creature’s orifice. When the connecting ducts contract, this thick fluid can be projected several meters. This substance will immediately begin to break down unprotected flesh into a heavy slime, suitable for the Ventriculant to ingest. Once the carrion is sufficiently decomposed, the creature will land beside the pool of pre-digested material and begin ingestion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Consumed food has one purpose, the growth of the heavy globules of flesh that hang from the Ventriculant’s body. Our specimen showed numerous scarring where sections of this tissue had been excised by its Alien handlers. Biopsy of the portions of the body that generate these gobbets of flesh revealed that the creature actually has a specialized form of cancer. As long as sufficient food is available, the Colucris’ tumors will continue to grow, until the creature collapses under its own weight.  It is obvious that this creature is the result of extensive genetic engineering. Its ancestors may have once been the Alien equivalent of the laboratory mice currently used in cancer research worldwide.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The organism’s open circulatory system renders it extremely vulnerable to any sort of damage.  Even the slightest wound will cause it to rapidly bleed to death.  However, the overlapping masses of flesh protect the main body from light weapons fire. </paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Species/Spawn</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>This horrible creature is extremely resistant and able to shrug off large amounts of damage due to its naturally ablative chitinous hide. Apart from the point of being extremely effective as a biological terror weapon due to its combat abilities, it also has the ability to inject any sufficiently large creature with an extremely fast-acting bacterial infection. This infection rapidly spreads through the host’s body, destroying the natural DNA in the cells and replacing it with modified Spawn DNA. This rapid destruction of cells causes the victim to enter into a homicidal berserk rage. After an apparently random period of time, or when the host reaches the point of death, the remnants of the victim’s skin is sundered by an emerging, fully formed Spawn.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This Alien monstrosity has several unique features that are not found in any Earth native life form. Due to the combination of features and the odd physical makeup of the creature, it is the theory of the Research Division that this creature was created for use as a living biological weapon. The Spawn appears to be of only animal level intelligence, unable to comprehend orders or directions and completely incapable of any level of social interaction. It appears that they are released to run wild and cause as much havoc as possible. Due to lack of an obvious control mechanism, they must either have an instinctual revulsion to the other Alien species, or the Aliens have means of control of which we are unaware at this time.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Spawn physical makeup appears to be designed to allow it to have the longest possible lifetime in an extremely hostile environment. It is very quick, flexible, and agile, allowing agility easily equal to anything on Earth. We have clocked the Spawn running at up to 48,28 km/h for short distances. The chitinous hide plating of the creature gives it a natural ablative covering that tends to break up, redirect, or scatter most known forms of projectile or directed energy weapons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Spawn is also very strong, able to penetrate most known types of armor plating with relative ease. It appears that the creature has thermally sensitive sections in its face plating and at the extremities, which allows it to hunt prey based on thermal triangulation. The claws of the Alien have a very peculiar concave serration; this means that wounds caused by a Spawn attack tend to be very wide and bloody, but not very deep; as it is not in the creature’s interest to kill its victim. This is because of the most dangerous property of the Spawn, its neurotoxicological venom.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The creature’s claws are coated with a thin layer of venom that is refreshed whenever the claws retract into the aperture over the hands. When attacking prey, the Spawn introduces this neurotoxin into the victim through minor wounds caused by the claws. The venom quickly spreads through the victim’s body, where it induces a two-stage transformation. The first stage occurs as the venom spreads to the brain. Once there, it induces a homicidal rage and triggers the production of chemicals to radically increase cell production. The victim becomes overwhelmed with a need to destroy members of its own species. It is apparent from the battle reports of Spawn attacks that victims immediately assume the mindset of a Spawn while the second stage of the poisoning continues. During this stage the poison attacks the bone marrow and lymph system of the victim and alters the DNA structure of new cells to a Spawn template. The other chemical markers of the cells are relatively unchanged, thus preventing immune reactions to the new cells. The new Spawn white cells begin attacking the remaining Human cells of the body, while the Alien cells work to replace the losses. This induces a rapidly accelerating physical change in the victim. Within a period of a few minutes, most of the major organs in the victim’s body are undergoing the mutation into Spawn equivalents.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The spike in cell production induced by the venom would be very beneficial in medical uses, if a means to separate it from the other effects could be found. Current tests indicate that the increase in cells is so rapid that the victim’s blood pressure from the increased volume practically doubles over the course of a minute. This increase in cell mass causes the host’s body to rip and split open after a random period of time. The natural cell growth and replication will result in the creation of a new Spawn within minutes, barring outside influences.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It has been discovered, however, that the application of heat in any form (including the heat of bullets, lasers, and all other known forms of ranged weapons) causes an exponential increase in the rate of transformation, resulting the completion of the transformation cycle in mere seconds.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Our Autopsy Division have completed the autopsy of the Spawn. The specimen got tough skin and bones due to a silicon coating, and it contain deadly bacteria that it injects into it’s victims to increase the Alien army by an additional Spawn.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The dead Spawn that X-corps members have recovered during mission, has proven that these specimen are very unique. Its bones have been strengthened by what seems to be a strong silicon coating, which cover all of the bones in the entire body. Due to the sheer weight of the alloys, the Spawns have grown enormous muscles to be able to control such weight. Any attempts to remove the silicon layer intact have resulted in failure, as it appear to have grown together with the bones themselves. When our department tried to force the silicon off with high-powered tools, both bone and coating crumbled. The merge between the silicon based coating and the carbon based bones, are the reason for this odd strength. And when The Autopsy Department broke the coating off, it weakened instantly. It is highly unlikely that the coating have been put </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Its skin is also covered in the same kind of coating, although this layer is thinner, and more flexible. The different parts of the shell fit perfectly over each other, and are therefore unlikely to have been implanted. Our scientists were very amazed, when they removed the plating and discovered that there was no real skin behind it. This also contributes to the theory that the spawns are indeed born with silicon skin and bones, as stripping off the entire skin wouldn’t serve any purpose if silicon was to be implanted. The strong silicon shell is acting like a very sophisticated skin, and it does in no way hamper the Spawns body motion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Most of the inner organs are surprisingly fragile, and puncture very easily. Heart, lungs, and the brain, however, are much more robust. The heart is very well developed, and appears to pump blood approximately 4 times faster then humans, which alone will result in amazing speed and manoeuvrability, as the brain will work better. The spawn have a huge almost swollen area of the brain, which appear to be the area of hand-to-eye coordination. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>But the properly weirdest and most chocking thing of the entire Spawn would be the claws. Not only are they razor sharp, but they are also covered in a highly deadly bacteria coating that is injected into its victims wounds: In just a few splits of a second, it has taken over the defences of the body, and the brain appear to go into a panic mode. In this trance of kamikaze, the victim will attack their friends, seeming as though they were mad. In such a state victims are, not surprisingly, nicknamed “Zombies”, for their characteristic dead look.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is not the only effect of the bacteria, however. It has been reported in the field, that the unfortunate victims in the “Zombie” state, will bust open after a while - resulting in a new hostile, battle-ready Spawn. However, as most of the bacteria perish when the Spawn itself dies, we have been unable to research further into this field. It would require a live specimen if we were to intend further investigation. </paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The large beasts known as Raptors are frequently seen in terror missions and Alien bases, mindlessly serving their Satyrian masters. They appear to be devoid of any emotions, save for an unearthly delight in tearing the enemy into shreds and feasting on its remains. Although appearing large and clumsy, the Raptors are actually extremely fast and agile creatures.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Raptor's intelligence was found to be somewhat limited. Although neural activities were very low in the cerebral cortex, particularly the frontal lobe, they were found to be particularly intense in the cerebellum. This shows that although cultural, intellectual, and creative aspects of the Raptor species are virtually nonexistent, the basic instinctual impulses are very well developed: muscle growth, reflexes, and balance are extremely refined. It is not wise, however, to simply dismiss a Raptor as stupid; using only its natural cunning instinct, or perhaps telepathic commands from a higher caste; Raptors have been known to stealthily ambush X-Corps patrols, either wiping out the teams themselves or creating a diversion that allows their Satyrian counterparts to seize an advantage within the chaos of death screams and torn flesh.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"Wilkins, get over here and cover my flank! One of those Raptors just went around that building...Wilkins? Wilkins! Respond, rookie! If I have to turn around... Hey, Wilkins where did you g-...Mother of...Noooooo [unintelligible]" -Last transmission from Corporal Nicholas Beauchesne.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Raptor's physical form in itself appears to be very simple, consisting only of a small abdomen, two massive legs, a head and an elongated tail to serve as a counterbalance to its bizarre physique. Although the Raptor has no arms, its lack of dexterous appendages is more than compensated for by its enormous crushing jaws and razor sharp fangs. Their bodies are also covered in a thick mantle of fur. Our scientists have discovered that the natural oils that coat the fur are highly combustible. Our knowledge about their origins is very limited and is a subject of pure speculation, but researchers unanimously conclude that their nature is predatory.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Peculiarly, ultrasound analysis detects what appear to be two fully functional hearts. This finding along with the amount of damage that is required to significantly wound one of these creatures, leads us to believe that the creature known as the Raptor not only possesses two hearts, but two pairs of lungs, and basically two sets of anything we could call “vital” organs. Only the most severe of wounds can bring one of these horrific creatures down; because of the redundant organ systems, anything short of incapacitating damage would allow the Raptor to continue functioning with little apparent effect. Multiple sets of vital organs serve other advantages as well: Raptors can sprint for long distances without growing tired, as their vital organs "cycle" to keep its body operating at maximum efficiency. Whether this feature is naturally evolved or is a feat of Alien genetic engineering will be addressed in a Raptor autopsy.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In summary, Raptors are fast, deadly, and aggressive predators that cannot be reasoned with and will stop at nothing to ensure the destruction of any Human that stands in their path. Raptors should be considered highly dangerous targets and eradicated when any opportunity presents itself.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>These monstrous aliens appear to be the embodiment of every mad scientist’s dream of biological terror. A detailed autopsy of the Raptor has revealed many important aspects of their biology that help explain why they are such a devastating fighting force.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Raptor averages between eight and ten feet in height, ground to hip, and 10 to 12 feet in length, nose to tail. Though the highest percentage of body weight is located forward of the hips; there are three annular fluid membranes, similar to the fluid membranes in the human ear, evenly spaced along the length of the tail that appear to function as balance organs to allow the Raptor to reach to impressive speeds it has demonstrated in the field. The musculature of the alien is very streamlined and smooth, highly optimized for running and agility. There are minor alien alloy implants to strengthen the joints and enforce the ligaments, to allow even tighter than normal turning.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The two most significant biological advantages of the Raptor are organ duplication and multiple visual spectra. Every major organ is duplicated and separated throughout the main body cavity and the upper thighs. This makes the Raptor exceedingly difficult to wound critically. The only organ that is not duplicated is the eyes. Raptors have 6 eyes that operate in pairs, but each pair of eyes perceives an entirely different spectrum of light. This allows the Raptor to visually track prey regardless of the environmental conditions. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Conversely, the only significant weakness that the Raptor has is it’s thick coat of oily hair. This fur makes the Raptor highly vulnerable to incendiary attacks. This weakness is further increased by thousands of glands, very similar to oil glands in humans, scattered over the Raptor’s flesh. The "oil" secereted is very similar in properties to high efficiency motor oil. The purpose of this oil appears to be to provide the Raptor with more efficient heat dispersion in warm and hot climates, and to keep the Raptor's coat clean and free of pests. Without this heat dispersion the Raptor would quickly overheat and collapse in most non-arctic environments.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>There are numerous small, alien alloy implants in various sections of the Raptor brain. While all of these devices were completely inert during the autopsy, it is the opinion of several Xcorp engineers that these devices are some form of receiver. From this assumption, and an analysis of the growth patterns of the neurons around the implants, it is the assertion of this department that the Raptor does not and cannot operate independently, and this is the primary reason they have only been seen in close association with other alien races.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>These creatures are extremely exothermic, capable of causing extreme burns merely by close proximity. The natural carapace of Alien Composites protects it from low caliber weapons, and incendiary ammunition is likely to be useless, given its internal temperature. Its innate ability to grow Alien Composites makes this creature, apparently, the Aliens’ source of this critical substance.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The live specimen recovery of one of these curious creatures has added a new twist to our understanding of Alien biology. Our standard Alien Containment units were inadequate to keep the creature alive; special and immediate modifications to the Alien containment facility were required in order to preserve the specimen, and thanks to our engineers' commendable work, we are now able to study these creatures in depth.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The stone-like Silabrate is a silicon-based life form, different from any other Alien species previously encountered. The metabolism of this creature is unique in the annals of science. While silicon biology had previously been theorized, there were numerous practical flaws. Terrestrial life forms oxidize carbon during the respiratory process, forming gaseous carbon dioxide. However, when silicon is oxidized, it forms silicon dioxide, a crystalline substance that would seem to prove a major impediment to continued respiration. The Silabrate seems to incorporate the residual silicon dioxide into defensive spikes, literally exhaling short, thick quartz crystals between the plates of its carapace.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The carapace may be the most curious item of all. Formed of irregular, overlapping plates of Alien Composites, it was assumed that the organism had been surgically altered, like many of the other Alien species had been, and the plates implanted; however, after a section was removed for analysis, the vulnerable area left by the excision was covered by a thin layer of Composites within hours, and a full-sized plate had grown within a few days. It appears that this species is the source of the Alien Composites. The exact method by which the Aliens cause it to grow large enough to be useful is still unknown. Theories run from some fashion of hormonal or mental control that causes oversized plates to be produced, to giant Silabrate ‘queens’ with armor plates several meters across. Whatever this method may be, we are currently unable to make good use of the Composites obtained from dead or alive Silabrates.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Silabrate seems to possess a most rudimentary form of intelligence, the equivalent to that of a terrestrial canine. At first, these creatures seemed to serve no obvious purpose; however, recent evidence leads us to believe that they do, in fact, serve some important purpose; we must find out what is it in order to successfully assess the true danger behind the existence of these creatures.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The specimen is exothermic to extremes, averaging a body temperature of 950 degrees Kelvin. The exact method by which this creature maintains such a high temperature is currently unknown. It ingests virtually any substance given to it, only refusing materials with too high a melting point. However, the discovery of a high proportion of depleted Uranium Dioxide and rare Beryllium compounds in the creature’s waste, along with the increased background radiation around the specimen, has led to the radical proposition that some form of atomic decay may be the source its heat.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due the extreme heat generated by this organism, it is recommended that our agents avoid close contact. The carapace provides it with exceptional armor, and our incendiary weapons pale in comparison to its own great heat.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Conducting autopsy research on a dead Silabrate specimen was a delicate operation that was carefully planned and executed. The use of Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) was inevitable. Preliminary study of the carcass proposed a skin temperature of 600 Kelvin at the time of death, which suggested an enormously exothermic interior of the body. Thus, a special thermal-shielded operating table was manufactured and then installed in the examination room. The CAS console was set up in a corner of the room, with a durable anti-thermal glass wall separating it from the operating theater.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It seems that the creature slowly produces Alien Composites which are physiologically integrated into its body as the outer layer of the skin or, in the presence of abundant raw materials, excreted. Although rather simple in appearance, the Silabrate body apparently operates in a remarkable way. At the same time, field reports indicate that Silabrates are low-intelligence organisms. With only this initial information, the operation started.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Our research team soon discovered that the toughness of the skin of the Silabrate greatly exceeds the capabilities of common surgical tools, such as scalpels. High-frequency surgical laser was an effective alternative. With the removal of what we estimated to be the equivalent of the epidermis, thermal sensors recorded a sharp increase in temperature which stabilised at around 450 Kelvin despite the fact that the alien had been dead for many hours.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Samples from the skin were extracted for analysis. The toughness of the skin is enough to break most matter into small pieces which the Silabrate can eat and digest via its stomas. We now have proof that Alien Composites are produced internally and then slowly migrate to the visible outer layer of the skin. The Silabrate metabolism can easily convert a grand variety of chemical substances and materials even with fairly high melting points. Apparently, these reactions take place in one of the two Silabrate organs, which works like a reaction chamber, lined with highly durable tissue. The contents of this organ turned out to be a heterogeneous mixture of collected materials, including plant and animal parts as well as a variety of rocks and metals.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The inner layer of the skin itself functions as a sensory, neural and muscular system at the same time. These multipurpose cells are capable of information uptake and processing and also possess the necessary contractility to produce locomotion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A significant quantity of an unusual compound was detected within the hot body fluids. It is suspected that this compound is the key factor in the production of the catalyst needed to efficiently create Alien Composites at relatively low temperatures.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The second gland-like structure is the rough equivalent of a heart, which takes up approximately 35% of the total body mass. Apart from circulating the Silabrate's body fluids, it also synthesizes the energy-rich compounds needed to sustain the Silabrate. The energy is stored as molecules with high-energy bonds and then used by the cells whenever needed. In addition, it produces the extraordinary thermal output the Silabrate needs for the production of Alien Composites.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We do not know if Silabrates are the main production agents of Alien Composites or just an alternative production factor. We have concluded that the Aliens may have genetically engineered the Silabrate in order to convert various materials into Alien Composites ready for use. The idea of using Silabrates to our own advantage was tempting, but proved impossible to effectuate. Live Silabrates are just too dangerous to be used for production. We have tried to insert substances into dead Silabrates, but we did not succeed in stimulating the synthesis procedure. In order to produce Alien Composites, we must utilize our own chemistry methods.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>ARTOPOD</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Species/Artopod</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Our operatives have managed to obtain a functional specimen of the robotic walkers that have been seen in Alien terror sites. These Alien creations have been named Artopods.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Artopod is a very effective Alien mechanical terror weapon. Deployed by the Aliens in Terror Sites, Artopods are usually found in company of the psi-capable Cloaks, a combination of deadly proportions. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Standing above two meters high, the sole sight of the robot is enough to cause panic wherever it is deployed. Initial observations conducted by scientific personnel indicate existence of extremely advanced metallic composites which reports from the battlefield indicate to be highly resistant to most of our standard weapon technology; the autopsy should reveal more information regarding the materials it has been constructed with and possible exploitable weaknesses.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The robots’ bodies are supported by three mechanical legs, which despite logic, appear to provide the Artopods with enough stability to move through any surface with ease, our scientists believe that this is due to the presence of advanced Alien gyroscopes within the walkers’ bodies.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The sensory equipment seems to be constituted by five “eyes” located in the upper portion of the body; we are unsure what these five sensors are capable of; we are certain, however, that Artopods are capable of perceiving infrared radiation, as they are very efficient at tracking down Humans in complete darkness.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Artopods seem to have a basic essential programming such as motor functions and targeting systems; however, reports from the field reveal that they are equipped with a sophisticated emergency system that activates once they receive enough damage to lose its optimal battle capabilities. Once the failsafe is triggered, some sort of self-destruct device is activated; the result is a terrible explosion with a blast radius large enough to pose a serious threat to any nearby operatives. It is likely that the emergency system was designed to prevent the capture of an Artopod. In theory this works, but in practice, we know that it is possible, to somehow disable the emergency system by shooting at lower part of the body, where we believe it is located. With the emergency system offline, the risk of explosion no longer exists.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>On missions where these mechanical terror weapons were present, the personal carrier’s sensors detected high frequency microwaves being emitted from the battlefield; these microwaves have been picked up in all sites in which the robots' presence was confirmed. The obvious conclusion is that the Alien creations hold a direct relation with these waves.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Currently there are two theories. The first one is that the Artopods are not autonomous terror weapons as initially thought, being just remote-controlled weapons platforms instead.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The second one is that the radio emissions are communications between the robots and the UFO’s main computer, some sort of battle log, possibly to provide data about Human military tactics and defensive capabilities, later to be used for better strategies to be employed in further attacks.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Evidence tends to favor the latter theory, as radio emissions are not continual, being intermittent instead, and are mostly originated when the robots are engaged in combat, as if the Artopods were reporting on which tactics were their attackers using. Doubt exists, nonetheless, but we will continue to work on it. We have tried to jam these radio waves, for some unknown reason we have so far been unable to. We cannot expect to gain any tactical advantage from this without proper knowledge of these emissions, which seems likely to remain elusive from us.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Overall, our Research Division believes that Artopods represent great danger to all X-Corps personnel on the field. Their arsenal of powerful weaponry and uncanny sense of coordinated attack make them dangerous and formidable opponents. They pose a major threat to all civilians and to unprepared operatives, and it is highly recommended that all operations proceed with caution when Artopods are present.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>ARTOPOD AUTOPSY</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Autopsies/Artopod</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Artopod is a walking Alien weapons platform. Armed with powerful and accurate plasma cannons, the Artopod is a threat not only to the civilian population, but to our tactical operatives as well. A direct hit from these cannons would easily damage, if not destroy one of our XCAPS.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Artopod is heavily armored with layers of Alien Composites and ionized matter. Testing revealed that this combination is marginally less efficient than one of Alien Composites alone at withstanding standard projectiles, AP projectiles, high explosives and incendiary ammo; however, the armor's ability to withstand plasma is extraordinary. Most of the Engineering Division believes that the armor was specifically designed by the Star-Spawn with this in mind, perhaps to avoid friendly fire or the usage of their own weapons against them. Testing also proved the armor to be notoriously less effective at withstanding laser attacks.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Within the core we found a miniature Xenium Reactor, containing only small amounts of Xenium-122, insignificant compared to what is salvaged from an UFO. A small emergency system was found within the Xenium Reactor: should the Artopod suffer enough damage, the failsafe activates and triggers an explosive. The inevitable reactor breach results in a powerful explosion, followed by the destruction of the Artopod and possible death of any nearby operatives.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A significant amount of organic matter was found inside the core, in addition to the reactor, it appears to play an important role in the Artopod’s autonomous system’s functioning. The concentration of organic matter in the core suggests that it possibly functions as a quasi-living CPU, very similar to an organic central nervous system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The main sensory equipment is composed by the five “eyes” positioned on the front portion of the upper body. The four “small eyes” seem to deal with specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including parts of infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, microwaves and visible light. The “large eye” responds generally to large portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including parts of gamma radiation. It also contains the targeting system; hitting the large eye could cause the Artopod to lose its targeting ability, greatly reducing its battle capabilities.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Supporting this weapons platform are three mechanical legs. Each one has four joints, and these are controlled by a complex form of hydraulics, powered by the Xenium Reactor. This system does not provide an abundance of stability, but is compensated with two gyroscopes that are integrated into the lower part of the chassis.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As the Artopod is robotic in nature, we were surprised to find that all parts contain organic matter, mainly the core. The Artopod is, however, not sentient. It seems to use an organic nervous system in place of electronics. This supports the theories that the Artopod is telepathically controlled, opposed to it being remotely controlled from an Alien craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Between the layers of Alien Composites that make up the armor of the Artopod, we found a myriad of isolated and highly ionized matter, both of negative and positive charge. Testing revealed that when hit by plasma, the non-conducting matter that isolates the ionized matter was evaporated. This results in a significant stream of ions, which in turn induces a magnetic field. Laser, however, seem to combust the non-conducting matter that isolates the ionized matter, leaving the Artopod vulnerable to laser attacks.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>At first the fields are created in random directions, therefore virtually neutralizing themselves. But when introducing an homogeneous electric field, the stream of ions becomes more systemized, inducing a stronger magnetic field. This magnetic field proved to be quite effective at repelling plasma, causing only a few layers of Alien Composites to be penetrated. Because the Artopod has multiple layers of Alien Composites and ionized matter, the armor can be hit several times in the same point leaving the core untouched. All attempts at reproducing the ionized matter have failed, due to the complexity of its construction.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Despite its organic appearance, this 'creature' is not a true species at all, but rather an artificial mobile weapons platform similar to our own MTC-01C tank design. Built and commanded by members of the Sagisati race (known to us as Greys), the Terror-Disc, or Aerodrone as it is referred to by its masters, is a formidable addition to the Alien ranks.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Aerodrone is a bio-mimetic device based on a common creature on the Greys’ home-world. Apparently the Sagisati equivalent of the terran dog is a pack-hunting crustacean capable of floating via internal hydrogen stores. These creatures were used for centuries as beasts of burden, guards, hunters and trackers. While the original species has been extinct for several hundred years, the Greys built cybernetic versions of this animal as replacements, keeping the body shape, replicating the flying ability with an on-board antigravity device, and implementing advanced AI controllers with psychotronic control interfaces allowing the Greys to use their powerful psionic abilities to control them. An attempt to replicate the original Aerodrone's pack-hunting mentality was also a success, creating the perfect mechanical monster. These mechanisms were most often used to track and capture creatures for their masters' genetic experiments</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With the arrival of a species they call the 'Tall Ones', and the subsequent co-opting of their civilization, the Sagisati adapted their cybernetic servants for war, adding layers of armor, a powerful plasma cannon, and a powerful self-destruct system, designed to inflict horrific damage even when disabled. Their grotesque appearance, combined with their hunting programming, makes them perfect weapons of terror to unleash against our civilian population. These strange machines present the greatest threat to our soldiers on the field, and should be eliminated as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Autopsies/Terror-Disc</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The Terror-Disc is surprisingly well armored against small arms fire and shrapnel (such as grenades and high explosive ammunition). Also note that the Terror-Disc’s plasma weapon is extremely accurate and that its hovering ability makes it able to take to the air for a better vantage point in combat.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The recovery of a mostly intact Terror-Disc is a significant accomplishment for our assault teams. It appears the self-destruct system was damaged during the firefight, limiting the explosion to internal systems, rather than the usual blast radius.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While the Terror-Disc bears a striking resemblance to earthly crustaceans, it is currently undecided whether this is a purely artificial device designed on bio-mimetic principles, or a once-living creature with extensive mechanical reconstruction. While well over ninety-five percent of the recovered material is clearly artificial in origin, trace amounts of organic ash are also present. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The outer 'skin' is formed of a thick layer of Alien Composites, providing the Terror-Disc with the ability to withstand significant attacks before being taken down. However, once the external armor has been pierced, the exposed internal equipment is quite fragile. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The foremost internals of the Terror-Disc consists primarily of a bewildering array of radar-based sensory nodes, giving this monstrous invention a full 360-degree range of 'vision', independent of light levels. The on-board plasma weapon is powered by a small Xenium-122 based generator occupying the rear third of the shell. The resultant plasma is fed to three accelerator channels on the exterior of the skin, each one guiding the charged plasma to the maw at the front of the Terror-Disc for release. The core of the body contains what must be the device that gives the Terror-Disc its flight capability as well as the primary control equipment.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, both the Alien hover device and the plasma generator were damaged beyond any hope of salvage or understanding. The characteristic explosion from a downed Terror-Disc seems to be specifically designed to focus its energies on the central core and the plasma reactor. It is hypothesized that the worst of the explosion actually results from the reactor itself losing containment of the recently generated plasma. It is unlikely we could ever recover a Terror-Disc with its core systems intact.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While the combination of the Terror-Disc's flight capability and powerful plasma weapon make it a formidable foe, the plasma mechanism itself may be its greatest weakness. Experiments show that the plasma accelerator channels on the edge of the carapace armor are susceptible to our standard armor-piercing ammunition. A carefully aimed shot can damage the containment surface, causing feedback into the reactor. This usually results in the destruct system triggering prematurely, and any Aliens in the vicinity are just as vulnerable as X-Corp personnel to the devastating results.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>“I’m torn between this thing being a robot, or some form of cyborg. Regardless, these things are very dangerous, and should be approached cautiously. Of course, each Terror-Disc is an explosion waiting to happen, especially if it is near a pair of Greys…” -Chief Engineer Scott Bernard, reflecting upon the Terror-Disc systems.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Capture and interrogation of a live Alien specimen and observation of Alien activities has allowed us to shed some light on some of the enemyâ€™s mysteries, namely, its origins. Though the information acquired was very limited, it has given us one important fact: the Aliens operate from within our Solar System.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Interrogation proved much more difficult than we had expected.  An extensive period of research was spent trying to interpret their language, with moderate success, but most of it remains obscure to us. What has been obtained so far, however, will undoubtedly be of great help in furthering our research.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The deciphering of the language was not the only obstacle; the subjects showed an uncanny resistance to race-specific interrogation procedures, enduring extreme methods with a determination that seems unnatural.  Information extracted during the interrogation was limited; the subject would invariably lapse into severe convulsions before critical intelligence was divulged. Because these convulsions would consistently occur at key moments during the interrogation, it would appear that some prior conditioning is preventing the subject from answering our queries fully.  However, this is speculation and has not been confirmed, it is assumed that the cause of the convulsions was the result of our lack of expertise when interrogating Alien creatures and their unknown mental training techniques.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After both extensive and intensive application of special persuasion procedures, our interrogators managed to come up with small pieces of the puzzle.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Apparently the Aliens are launching their attacks from an undisclosed location within the Solar System, as the subject revealed that the "small vessels" (what we call UFOs) are not Faster-Than-Light (FTL) capable, meaning that travel from the nearest star of Alpha Centauri would take several years, and thus is not the source of the enemy's attacks. This, however, has raised another question.  The Alien talked about "small vessels". This could indicate that there are "large vessels" which might be able to achieve FTL travel.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We have taken our first step in understanding the Alien threat.  We know the main attack force is based on a local planet. A moon is an unlikely possibility because of the inevitable instability and high risk of being hit by other planetoids. A large asteroid is also a possibility. There is also the matter of the varied Alien species that comprise the invasion force; it seems highly unlikely that numerous intelligent species would share a homeworld without falling into conflict, given their aggressive nature. We are, however, still clueless on the matter of the true Alien origins.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>Extensive research into the issue of the Aliens' main base of operations' location has finally paid off. Our agents on the field have been able to capture several live Alien creatures, among them, a Leader of the invasion forces. Interrogation of the captured Alien officer has allowed us to decipher one of the last mysteries we are to resolve in order to stop this war and eliminate the Alien threat once and for all. The enemy's main stronghold lies on Mars, the fourth planet of our very own Solar System.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Excerpt from Alien Leader Debriefing</paragraph>
        <paragraph>[X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Debriefings/Deb#281-b]</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Interrogator: [Spc. Mark Dufraine] and [Spc. Eileen Iwosaka]</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Spc. Iwosaka (EI): This is the interrogation of a captured and pacified Alien leader. Due to the importance of this interrogation, and my high aptitude for psionics, I have volunteered to try to establish communication with the Alien being through telepathic means. I have surrendered my weapons to one of the MPs on guard in the room. They have been ordered to sedate both me and the Alien should anything appear to be going wrong. Questions will be prompted and recorded by Specialist Dufraine, in the control room. I am ready to begin.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>{Spc. Iwosaka assumes the lotus position, and visibly relaxes. The Alien, who had been looking around the room, turns and focuses on Spc. Iwosaka.}</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Spc. Dufraine (MD): Specialist Iwosaka, can you hear me?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: Yes. I can hear you.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: Have you contacted the Alien?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: I think so. I'm getting some very confusing signals. It wants to get in my head. It's cold.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: Are you ready to give it a question?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: Yes. I'm letting down my guard a little, let it get inside and see if that makes things easier.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: What was the purpose of your ship?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: It says that we cannot hope to defeat them. Things will be much easier if we just lay down our weapons and surrender.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: What is your name and rank?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: Names are meaningless abstractions for sentient beings. It says only a minor race such as humans require names for themselves. Its ship designation was 110011010101.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: Where did your ship originate from?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: ...It won't tell me that.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: Where was your ship headed?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: It won't tell me that either. I'm going to try to push deeper.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>{Spc. Iwosaka's face contorts into an expression of painful concentration. A thin trickle of blood begins to ooze out of her nose}</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: Don't push it too hard.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: It.. It's resisting. Fighting back... Let me in you slimy... Ah! I think I see now... wait, there is something more... it's like... locked! As if a part of the creature's mind was completely locked, I'll try to get in see what's it hiding...</paragraph>
        <paragraph>MD: You've been long enough there, get out!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>EI: I'll try to break the mental lock... What the..!??, NOOooooooooo!!!</paragraph>
        <paragraph>{Spc. Iwosaka and the Alien start to shake as in terrible pain, the MPs immediately step forward and stun both Spc. Iwosaka and the Alien into unconsciousness}</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Notes: Spc. Iwosaka recovered, but appears to have lost any psionic ability that she had due to her extremely close encounter with the Alien intelligence. She reports that the last image she was able to recover from the Alien was an view of a reddish planet from orbit. Further debriefing and research indicates that this planet is most likely Mars. Unfortunately Spc. Iwosaka was unable to gather precise location of the Alien base or bases on the fourth planet. The mental lock Spc. Iwosaka described in the Alien's mind remains a mystery, apparently the single attempt to break the lock triggered some sort of mental defense mechanism, which has resulted in the Alien suffering a cardiac arrest. [...]</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Thanks to the deciphering of the Alien language, we have been able to successfully translate data logs from captured Alien craft; the gathered information corroborates our interrogation, the source of the Alien attack is Mars.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The last scan of the Martian surface (Mars Global Surveyor, 2004) did not reveal anything that indicated the presence of any sort of structure on the planet. Our Research Divisions theory is that the base is completely hidden, that is why our probes and satellites have revealed nothing on Mars, despite the fact that the Alien stronghold seems to have been there for several centuries. As there is no indication of Alien technology capable of cloaking a base from satellite scans, our scientists agree that the most likely option is the base being underground, so the possibility of missile bombardment is off the table; our operatives will have to conduct a direct assault through the very gates of the Alien stronghold in order to destroy it once its exact location is discovered.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The base contains the massive equipment used to build the enormous Alien fleet we have so far encountered and the large quantities of the precious Xenium-122 that is used to power the Alien vessels and armament. Also, our Biochemistry Department strongly believes in the possibility of cloning facilities, used to create the invasion army, if this is true it would mean that any eventual assault will most likely encounter fierce resistance, as the Alien forces have not been much weakened, they have only been slowed down.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The sheer size and coordination of the extraterrestrial attack suggests there is some greater element at play here, straying from the theories that proposed a united, cohesive effort brought on by a collective of Alien races, it appears that the only feasible way the Aliens could orchestrate such a massive undertaking would be of a military-like societal structure. Ideally, the head of the serpent lies in the form of a higher hierarchy, something beyond everything we have seen so far. We might be dealing with a completely different Alien species, something we have not yet encountered.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We already know that Alien attacks on our populations are directed from the Alien bases on Earth, what we still do not know is who is that it gives the orders to these bases, it might be a sole individual, like a king or emperor, or even a council of some sorts, it's quite hard to say what the driving force really is. Is our enemy led by a group, or by an overlord?</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Further research into this matter is of critical importance to Earths very survival; we have been attempting to put up an effective defense against the Alien incursions ever since the beginning of this war, unfortunately it is now clear that we are fighting a losing battle, our only choice is to switch from defense to offense, and to do it immediately, otherwise it will be too late for the Humanity to prevent an Alien victory.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Once we obtain accurate information regarding the Aliens' chain of command, we will be able to prepare an effective offensive against it, for now we have no real chance of stopping the Invasion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Our Research Division believes that we cannot obtain more information from low-ranking Aliens, we must interrogate the highest-ranking Alien officers: the Alien Commanders, well protected inside Alien Earthly bases.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>"I believe there is enough evidence of a superior creature pulling the strings here, I've observed the captured Aliens' brain wave patterns, they are similar to those of soldiers who have been mind controlled while on the field, you know?, the brain wave patterns get scrambled and reorganised in a way they're sensitive to external manipulation, I'm convinced there is something more behind all this, and I'm not talking about Cloaks, oh no, the patterns are in there too, that means that it's something we've never seen before"</paragraph>

        <paragraph>When we began fighting this war against the Alien agressors, we believed that it could be won on earth. We thought that if we could shoot down enough of their UFOs, find and smoke out enough of their bases and kill enough of their soldiers, we could scare the Aliens away or at least make them see that fighting us is a waste of resources. But the more we learned about them, the more it became clear that they would not just stop. They would continue to attack, abduct, investigate and terrorize us with a neverending supply of Aliens - Aliens apparently fighting without fear, remorse or pause beyond rational thought. By more than a few of our soldiers, they are described as "driven". We now believe that  this is, literally, true: The Aliens may be under psionic control of a single commanding entity.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The information forced from the Alien Commander shows us that we have to eradicate the Alien threat at its source. This source is an underground stronghold, the "Motherbase", located in an area of our red neighbour mars we code-named Thanatos. We have no reason to doubt that humanity is fighting a losing battle and cannot possibly win a drawn-out war unless a final, decisive victory at Thanatos is achieved.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Further data gathered in the interrogation speaks of a single "brain" behind the assault. The obscure and sometimes contradicting statements on this subject lead us to believe that the researched Alien has been the victim of memory-modification to keep us from gaining access to this information. Despite this, we have been able to extract some believable facts. We are now convinced that there is one single Alien, a creature we have come to call "Overmind", that controls the invading forces. In-depth analysis of the most recent Mars surface scans has confirmed many of the commander's statements. On the surface the whole installation looks almost like a normal crater, explaining why our previous scans were unable to identify it.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We suspect the location of the "Overmind" to be inside this Mars base, although this cannot be ascertained by analysis of our data. The only way to prove this assumption is to enter the base, a difficult task since, according to our information, it is heavily guarded. Nonetheless, we must dare this expedition or our planet will be overrun. Our objective is to gain entry into the Alien Motherbase, confirm the existence of the so-called Overmind, and destroy it.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Our strategic analysts claim that when the "brain" is gone, the "body" will cease to function. The more primitive Aliens will no longer act like soldiers, instead reverting to more primal patterns of behavior. The more intelligent ones might even rebel against the invasion - a path of action that kills so many of them. In any case, the command structure of the invading forces should be severely disrupted, giving us an invaluable advantage should they continue to attack.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>We will need an XC-33 Vengeance to transport our most experienced combat personnel equipped with destructive arsenal to Thanatos. This will be the final battle. This is do or die. There is nothing more for us to do here but await the outcome of this desperate assault. The fate of the Earth lies in the hands of X-Corps.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Alien Research missions are of minor concern to X-Corps troops, and pose minimal danger to Earth citizens. Research missions are carried out by the smallest Alien crafts, with a limited crew capacity. A lower priority should be assigned to these non-fatal Alien Research missions. However, it must be noted, that with every Alien ship downed and recovered, we gain valuable research material.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The first Alien missions concentrated primarily on biological and geographical research. Historical records show that the Aliens have surveyed our planet for at least sixty-five years, perhaps even longer. It is very likely that the Aliens have specifically adapted their war efforts to our planet, as many of their operations seem to be based on their gathered data. As in any conflict, intelligence and reconnaissance are the keys to success, and the Aliens have clearly made an effort to know their enemies as well as their battlefield.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although many of the surveys were performed by simple reconnaissance missions, some issues required deeper study. The Aliens have primarily concentrated their efforts towards locating resource deposits, which would become targets for later Alien Harvest missions. It is also likely that the observation of human psychology had affected the Aliens' overall strategy, to include strikes at civilian targets, to generate discontent, and destabilize human societies.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Current Alien activity reports indicate that actual Alien Research missions have become more sporadic than before. Our theorists have put forward the ominous suggestion that this may indicate the Aliens have already discovered whatever arcane knowledge they sought.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>From the first days of UFO sightings, there have always been incidents involving civilians. Nowadays, it is not only statistically proven that the occurrences of such attacks have increased, but in addition, the Aliens are taking their threats against populace to a new level. They used to simply disturb the rural population. Now, they do not hesitate to attack and terrorize urban and metropolitan areas around the world. At present, it is not known whether this is a response to continuing X-Corps resistance in order to weaken its support or merely another stage in the Aliens' plan to subjugate humanity. The Intelligence Division has managed to acquire new information from a captured extraterrestrial and compiled a report on discovered patterns in the Alien attacks on civilian centers.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In each one of the recorded confrontations, the Aliens used a special craft type we call the "Intimidator" to dispatch troops in close range to their target area. These terror troops usually consist of a homogenous squad of Aliens, supported by their associated species and/or autonomous weapons platforms - which proved to be just as deadly, if not more, as conventional human tanks. These squads have the sole objective of systematic eradication of human life, destruction of resources in the immediate vicinity and the demoralization of the local leadership.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Once the assaulting force is deployed, the Intimidator immediately takes off and exits the atmosphere. If the terror mission is successful and the majority of the original strike force is still alive, then the vessel performs re-entry and collects them. The evacuation is swiftly performed, prohibiting our aircrafts from intercepting the Intimidator, which vanishes into space. The Xenobiologists speculate that the terror soldiers are either strictly disciplined and do not hesitate to fight to death, or even that they are trained kamikaze units. Whatever the reasoning behind their attacks, their tactics are effective, making them a dangerous threat.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Due to the sheer disparity in arms and equipment, local law enforcement officials are easily overrun before firing a single shot. X-Corps' established doctrine demands that participatory governments are to actively withdraw all military forces in the area, as well as enact a large-scale evacuation effort, whenever possible, in order to minimize risk of collateral damage upon arrival of agency ground forces. Nevertheless great caution is advised, since careless tactics will undoubtedly result in heavy casualties.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>An analysis by the Tactical Command has led to the conclusion that it is of utmost importance to repel any threads to the civilian population. Although we cannot exactly calculate the consequences for the affected populous and government, it is quite possible that a progressed Alien activity will lead to resignation of the affected country. In order to ensure prolonged funding and avert incidents of population panic, we have to confront these Alien terror missions head-on whenever applicable.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Alien Harvest</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Alien Harvest was perhaps the first observed Alien activity on Earth. Though many scientists believe that the Aliens use the terrestrial fauna for sustenance, some believe the harvested materials are synthesised into medication or perhaps other chemicals (Concoction?), not to dissimilar from the way that drugs companies use some fauna for painkillers. Others maintain the less credited theory that the plant and animal tissues are used strictly for their nefarious genetic modification experiments. This is a largely unsupported theory due to the lack of knowledge of Alien genetic experiments.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>“They took my cows, all of them… they took them and… done real nasty things to them. I found two of them this mornin’ cut right up the middle, all their insides missing too.”</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Billy Bob “Tiny” Taylor, eye witness of the Alien Harvest</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The first signs of “Alien Harvest” were cattle mutilation in the southern states of the USA and in other areas including Africa and in some parts of the Europe. It seems the Aliens do not need, or have use for all the cattle’s organs. This would explain why the cattle were found with internal organs missing. It seems that what is taken from each cattle can differ, but largely if is found that larger muscles (such as the heart) in the body are favoured. The most realistic theory for this is that the Aliens require the large amounts mitochondria found in muscle the cows tissue, this could also show why cattle are taken over other forms of livestock. Recent research has shown that the Aliens use the mitochondria and graft it into the cells of the Alien young. By doing this, the next generation of Alien possess far greater endurance than the previous. After this the digestive system seems to be favoured, it is thought that the gastric acids may be useful to the Aliens in their research. There is no notable pattern to the organs removed or left. But the main consistencies are; the heart, legs and lower back muscles are removed as well as the stomach and intestines. But the main thing which baffles scientists is that the pancreas is always left; there is no evidence as to why this is the case. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Questions are still asked as to why the Aliens return the remains of the cattle to where they were found. At first scientists believed that the Alien’s conducted their “operations” on the ground. However, there have never been any eye witness accounts of this happening, and it is thought that the Aliens would rather minimise the chance of being disturbed by travelling back into orbit until they had finished then returning the remains. A possible suggestion to this is that the Aliens return the mutilated cattle to Earth merely to create a sense of panic among the population, although some are so bold as to say that it is a grisly prank.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Crop circles also appeared as another large sign of the Alien Harvest, whilst only a small amount of crops were trampled, evidence has found that the symbols made in the crop (Mainly cereals) were used as markers to show harvest ships which crop to reap. But the public discovery of crop circles lead to wide spread denial of all Alien connection with crop circles and members of the public were paid by the government to “confess” making the crop circles as a hoax.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The [Harvester] is the Aliens primary craft for reaping their harvest. From eye witness accounts it is seen that it is a medium craft, which is heavily armed. It can only be estimated that the Alien presence on board the craft is low considering its purpose.* </paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>As the harvests became more frequent, world governments started to acknowledge the problem with less scepticism and became very concerned as to how to deal with the problem. Various leaks of Alien Harvest news to the word media also started to create a cloud of anxiety amongst the population and growing the call for something to be done about it. Although this still remains a low priority on X-Corps “to-do-list”.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.Net/Alien/Research/Abductions</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The first Alien abduction was reported in 1961, a married couple travelling to New Hampshire was abducted by an UFO; under hypnotic regression, the couple managed to remember being taken into the Alien vessel and being examined by short, big-headed grey creatures. We now know that these once mythical beings, commonly called Greys for obvious reasons, are real, and form an integral part of the Alien invasion.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Since 1961, Alien abductions have been occurring almost incessantly, Humans have been abducted from almost every location on our planet, and all reports are found to be very similar; taken by a Collector to later be examined by grey Aliens, and then returned to the place of abduction, often under the effects of memory loss.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The abductees are subject to examinations performed by the so-called Greys and previously unheard of floating creatures we now call Satyrians, it is most likely that the Aliens seek biological weaknesses to exploit in this campaign that has been launched against our species, fortunately for us however, so far their efforts seem to have been in vain, as their weaponry is not especially designed to fight Humans, we have found no evidence that the Aliens possess neither biological or chemical weapons, thus we can only conclude that either the Aliens have been unsuccessful in their search for exploitable biological weaknesses, or that if they possess such weapons, they have not yet employed them for undetermined reasons; the latter is regarded as highly unlikely. The Aliens, however, have not completely failed in their goal of finding an effective way of fighting our species; our operatives have made a disturbing discovery inside a Collector vessel, what our scientists believe is the fruit of fifty years of studies into the structure of the Human body, a powerful and extremely effective neurotoxin, specifically designed to target Human cells. The full extent of the neurotoxin's capabilities remains beyond our abilities at this point, though it is undoubtedly that we will most certainly see this neurotoxin in action, as it is fairly obvious that the Aliens will not miss the chance to wield it against us, in which form we cannot tell, the toxin has to be injected into our bloodstream in order to act, our scientists think that it can be used in the form of darts; dart guns, however, do not seem to fit into what we have seen in the Alien arsenal.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The most horrifying aspect of Alien abductions are not the examinations themselves, it is the tampering of the Human body for research purposes. Inside Collector craft, we have found Human body parts inside tanks filled with green fluids of composition unknown. Our theory is that these body parts are either used for food, or for replacements of determined organic parts of Alien equipment; as we have observed some partially organic devices inside Alien craft, these, however, are not widely employed by the invaders and certainly do not conform part of the arsenal we have at this point seen. From victims' testimonies, it has come to our knowledge that we have not even scratched the surface of the real truth behind these examinations; subjects are usually kept alive during surgeries for removal of organs, or for studies on behaviour of Human tissues to varied stimuli, our operatives have even found victims split open on tables, the expression of pure horror in their faces strongly suggests that all Alien surgeries are performed without any kind of anaesthesia, this is corroborated by the fact that no anaesthesia of any kind has been found on board the Alien vessels. No restraints of any sort have been found, this leaves open to discussion how do the Aliens do to keep their Human victims immobile to operate.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As stated in numerous reports, abducted women have been impregnated with Alien foetuses and once given birth, the foetuses were retrieved by the Aliens to never be seen again. We have managed to obtain samples of these foetuses, found on jars inside the Alien ships. It appears that the star spawn are attempting to create some form of Alien-Human hybrid, with little success so far. Any foetuses that our researchers have been able to recover were dead and for due reason: their genetic composition was highly unstable; the creatures were most likely to have died shortly after being born. To what purpose the extraterrestrials are attempting to create these hybrids we are not sure of, but judging from our experience with them, it's probably not in Mankind's best interest to wait and find out. We are, unfortunately, still unsure whether the Aliens have had any success at creating these abominations or not, as we do not and can not have complete knowledge of the Aliens', both past and present, activities regarding Human research and manipulation. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>We know that there are uncountable people that have been abducted and, in some way, toyed with by the Alien creatures, as we are unable to keep track of all abductees, we are unable to unveil the true reasons behind Alien abductions, we have no clue of what was done to all Human captives, we have evidence that genetic modification of Human foetuses was not rare occurrence, to what purpose and which are the effects of these genetic modifications, we cannot know.</paragraph>
      </body>

        <paragraph>"The problem is that we cannot see the whole picture here, we know that the bugs are using body parts as hardware, all right, but why is it that the bugs like so much to play with our DNA?, we received a report of a child that was capable of lifting things with his mind with utmost ease, caused panic in his hometown, hadn't those creeps gotten there before us, we could have a small clue of what are they doing. If you ask for my opinion, I think the bugs have other plans for us rather than plain annihilation, all those years of studies just to destroy us?, they want something else from us, and all that research has something to do with it."</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Research/Retaliation</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Since the beginning of the Alien menace, humanity has sustained various forms of hostile alien activities. These could be either simple responses to immediate threats, such as dogfights, or of even greater importance, such as surgical strikes against human settlements and resource harvesting. Nevertheless, these kinds of Alien activity seem to be disassociated from X-Corps' direct intervention.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, once the Aliens regard their plans as seriously disrupted, the only natural consequence is to attempt to take the fight to X-Corps itself. Alien retaliation missions are direct assaults against the foundation's bases, facilities and personel. Long-term success in UFO interception and disruption of enemy logistics and ground operations seems to be the only factor triggering this very aggresive retaliation. This reaction backs our current hypothesis that the alien forces lack the necessary resources to compensate for continuous casualties. The fact that our enemy is willing to perform such an attack on the organization is hard evidence that our interference in their operations has a more profound impact than we previously assumed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Retaliation missions are performed with high precision, taking special care in maintaining the surprise element, the lack of time for a decent preparation against the Alien assault prohibits any sort of proper evacuation procedures to take place. The Aliens' objective is to exterminate all personnel and raze the base. Ground assault forces sent to directly attack an X-Corps base are likely to be large and consisting of elite soldiers, with no possibility of retreating or surrendering. Thus, it is vital that such an aggression be countered as soon as it is initiated. Reactionary activities like UFO interception, although not to be underestimated, will possibly prove difficult to accomplish in such a limited timeframe.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Should the attacking vessel manage to break through the base defenses, appointed defense squads should expect fierce and brutal close quarter fighting, with the possibility of engaging against overwhelming odds once the Alien assault squad invades the perimeter.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Scaling back our activities to avoid attracting attention, while being a wise medium-term strategical decision, would prove to be detrimental to our efforts in the long-term outlook. Nevertheless, it is prudent to work with stealth. Our most effective countermeasure is concealment. To attack the X-Corps, one of our or: the target base? bases must first be located, requiring aerial reconnaissance. Hindering hostile aerial activity, in addition to eschewing interception launches and communication whenever Alien vessels are near, should thus minimize the chances of detection. Once a Retaliation mission is launched, every effort must be made to prevent the attacking vessel from reaching the base. If the Aliens manage to penetrate the security perimeter, it will come down to the base's personnel to fight for their lives. This type of mission, although rare, poses the single greatest threat to X-Corps personnel and assets. In extreme cases, the project's very survival may hinge upon successfully repelling these attacks.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>X-Corps' mission statement is to repel the Alien threat and protect humanity at all costs. Thus, detection and interception of UFOs are our primary strategic objectives. Puzzled by evidence of established flight patterns of Alien craft, X-Corps put forth two possible scenarios: the existence of a mother ship in orbit and/or fixed military bases on Earth. After careful analysis of Alien Navigator interrogation logs and other available data, we have confirmed the existence of Alien military bases on Earth, though the existence of a mother ship continues to be a possibility and cannot be enitirely ruled out. We have also learned that the Aliens generally follow a three-stage procedure for establishing bases.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The first and longest stage consists of the surveillance and preparation procedures, in which Scouts are launched in order to examine the landscape, locate human settlements and document notable features. Larger vessels are progressively sent in to perform detailed scans and further scouting of the area. Whenever new information is acquired, the navigator sends the data back to the alien HQ. Once enough data to successfully establish a safe perimeter and build a base has been gathered, a battleship is sent to the pre-determined location to begin the excavation process. Upon arrival, it will hover over the ground, using gravitational waves to create a deep, leveled hole designed to support and contain the future underground base.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The second stage, usually taking around two weeks, includes the actual construction of an extensive underground tunnel complex. For this, several teams of alien engineers and workers are deployed to the site. One of the first tasks is the installation of a detection array, allowing automated intruder detection and prompt warning, leading to a precipitate camouflage of the building site. After the general framework has been completed, the battleship will drop large sheets of alien composites as lining of the roof and tunnel walls.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>During the third stage, the last essential steps prior to the base's completion are performed. Extra wall segments are added, the interior of the complex is furnished and the compartments become ready for various operations. Power sources are set-up and foliage is planted in order to provide a suitable environment for the whole installation. Two areas serve as gravity lifts in order to permit access to the complex. A large gravity lift is mounted on the lower floor and leads up to the control room where computers, electronic equipment and communication arrays are located. Once the command center is established, the whole system performs needed diagnostics, undergoes calibrations and finally boots. At this point, a battleship will backfill the site with the spoils, while the engineers fine-tune the site's camouflage for total integration in the surrounding environment. With the ending of the third stage, base construction is completed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In order to detect an Alien Base, our crafts must execute advanced surveillance and spying techniques at suspected locations. Reconnaissance photographs and data will be provided to X-Corps experts for analysis. The Intelligence Division remarks that increased Alien activity will be detected around established bases.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>As any military operation of this extent, the Alien invasion is a massive logistical undertaking, which begins with the setting of footholds on strategic positions, namely in this opportunity, on our own planet, from where close-up observation and quick attacks are possible. The need for a steady supply route is evident as we assume most of the construction materials come from an off-world location.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>To ensure this permanent flow of material and personell to and from of earth it seems that for each location the aliens established several flight corridors which apparently are used in random order, so we can never tell from which direction a freighter might enter the atmosphere or where it might head next.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In addition to this the interrogated Alien spoke of plans for multiple freighters targeting one coordinate and other diversionary maneuvers like immense Alien activity in remote areas. It seems that we'll even have to expect escorted freighters as a reaction to massive X-Corps activity in a certain area. We can assume that vast freighter losses will lead to a change in this relatively defensive strategies and might provoke a retaliation mission.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>An analysis of the alien flight plans has revealed that once a new alien base is to be established, frequent supply missions, beginning with the construction of the foundation and throughout the entire building process are performed.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In the first days the large Alien Freighters carry building materials such as raw alien alloys and pre-manufactured wall parts, up to entire, almost functional, base elements as well as heavy construction site equipment, while later on life-support systems and other high-technical equipment is delivered. From that on the new base is fully operational and expeditiously expanded. During the whole operational time the supply missions continue on in a reduced frequency.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As the Alien bases do not seem to be able to produce every needed good themselves, the freighters carry an amount of various cargo like weaponry, food, medical equipment and in particular the rare Xenium-122 to supply existing outposts. On their way back ? leaving the earth orbit ? they often carry large tanks filled with organic fluids as well as containers packed with various plants.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Whenever a huge frequency of supply missions is noticed, the construction of a new alien base in the surrounding area can be assumed. Extensive scouting missions in these sectors are recommended.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Research/Alien Goal</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Our research division has finally pieced together enough information to decipher the Aliens' grand scheme behind their presence on Earth, as well as how they intend to accomplish their fiendish goals.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Evidence points to the fact that the arrival of the "Star-Spawn", as the Aliens refer to themselves as a collective group, in our Solar system has to be dated around 500 BC. We were able to triangulate a possible flight vector placing their origins at a location near Beta Persei approximately 115 light-years from Earth. Reasons unknown to us forced the ship occupied by the "Overmind" - as we refer to the Alien leader of the Star-Spawn - to crash land on Mars. To ensure its survival, the crippled ship placed the Overmind in stasis and kept only essential life support systems online, hoping to receive an answer to the automated distress signal broadcasted into space. At this point it is not clear if Earths first radio transmissions at the end of the 19th century had any impact upon the awakening of the Overmind. The transmissions might have been interpreted as the long anticipated answer to the distress signal or may simply have been analyzed as non-hostile and possibly exploitable. What we do know is that around this time something caused the ships computer to awaken the Overmind from stasis. Seeing a way out of its misery, it took interest in the Terrans, a species that had not been detected on his approach due to their previous lack of advanced technology.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>From recovered UFO logs and Alien interrogations we learned that the Overmind's minions had already established a presence on Earth in the late 1930s. We do not know exactly why it took the Overmind more than three decades to undertake activities on earth, however we suspect a massive cloning program as well as establishment of an operational base and construction of a medium sized fleet. Nevertheless, the purpose of these activities remains ambiguous, as no significant data is available. It is likely that the Aliens' operations consisted mainly of observation and harvesting of biological resources, however with the outbreak of World War II, they were able to gain a deep insight into the nature of Human psyches and military tactics used around the world, as nations collided in war against one another. The Overmind must have been very impressed with our ability to kill and destroy with no apparent remorse, no doubt, especially with the utter destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After a thorough sighting of worldwide intelligence agency archives, we are able to say that human abductions presumably began in the 1960s; with the first report being made in 1961, the possibility of Alien presence on our world became real for a small portion of our planet's population; however evidence was scarce and the Aliens' activities were almost completely unnoticed. Undoubtedly these abductions told the Aliens a great deal about our physiology and psychological profile, but they were particularly designed to decode the Human Genome; countless genetic experiments were performed upon Human subjects aimed at achieving a more thorough understanding, and other, more sinister goals.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Historical research has shown a strong correlation between a birth increase of psionically-skilled individuals and Alien Research/Abductions in the corresponding areas. There have always been legends and tales of men and women capable of performing the most amazing feats beyond human capacity; many of these merits were regarded as magical in nature, as their practitioners could read thoughts or even lift objects without physical contact but by mere concentration of thought. Though these people tended to maintain their psionic nature a secret, the historical analysis by X-Corps scientists led to the discovery of an increased number of individuals capable of such actions in the last forty years. It is speculated that this "psionic boom" is very much related with an Alien manipulation of Human DNA. Psionic abilities however, have proven to be inherent to the Human species; our inability to make use of them is due to the general population's lack of knowledge and training on these, as only very psionically strong subjects are able to wield, or even notice, these aptitudes without training of any sort; it is likely that at least some DNA manipulations were precisely aimed at enhancing our natural psionic vocation.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When the Aliens' presence became unquestionably evident for all governments around the world in 2011 after the first UFO was shot down and international intelligence agents had the opportunity to analyze the wreckage, the Aliens changed their tactics from mere observation to aggressive interaction; they had amassed enough information to proceed with decisive action. Unnecessary observation outposts were dismantled - human technology had advanced to the point where these poorly defensible research outposts could possibly be detected and easily captured. Military bases were erected to support the imminent Alien ground operations, Alien Freighters were dispatched from Thanatos to deliver necessary equipment and resources such as the precious Xenium-122 and Alien Composites. Construction of larger attack vessels began almost immediately after the downing of the first Alien Probe in 2011. We suspect that assembly of all UFOs takes place on Mars as only basic maintenance equipment was found on earth bases.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With our currently available intelligence on Alien operations we have finally uncovered the real objectives behind the Aliens' efforts to conquer our planet: Integration of biological and material resources into the Star-Spawn, especially of mankind's great ability of creative thought. Of all the Alien species encountered, none was found to be acting on its own free will; all Alien creatures are manipulated by the Overmind in order to gain a foothold on Earth. Our scientists agree that although all Alien species have been tampered with cybernetically or genetically to be more effective on the battlefield, they all once possessed untainted biologies, originated from planets of their own and were at some point in their history captured by the Overmind, freezing their social and technological development at the point of their assimilation into the Star-Spawn.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We have come to the conclusion that completely assimilating Earth's population into the Star-Spawn by mind controlling us would ultimately prove counterproductive for the Overmind. Instead, it seeks to brainwash us into willingly following its lead. That way it can make full use of our inborn abilities - being a natural combination of those that the Aliens' have obtained only through cybernetic and genetic modification. We are capable of developing strong psionic powers - comparable to those of the Cloaks. Our soldiers have proven to be a match on the battlefield even for the best Alien troops, and the Human brain structure is more developed than that of most Alien species, second only to that of the Greys, but our great advancement of free thought, allowing for development of new strategies as well as technologies, is perhaps our greatest attribute so desperately needed by the Overmind to face those who forced it to retreat to our corner of the galaxy.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Refraining from using the massive weapons of destruction undoubtedly at his disposal, the overmind is ensuring that the traits he so desperately seeks to exploit remain embedded in humanity, as wiping out a huge proportion of Earth's population would put a dent in our resillience and ingenuity.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After analyzing possible flaws in this strategy being employed against us, we have come to the conclusion that all steps in the Star-Spawn's tactics were the result of careful and calculated planning. Terror missions are the most viable way for the Aliens to seize power; to terrorize mankind to the point where individual nations submit to them; signing treaties that would slowly grant full power to the Star-Spawn. The Overmind had plotted an intricate master plan which, fortunately for us, had the only flaw of underestimating mankind's willingness to stand together in desperate times.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The fact that we, as genetically unmodified humans, are succeeding in our stubborn resistance against the Overmind's array of heavily-enhanced Aliens only demonstrates our potential and makes us all the more valuable. It makes us shudder for the future of the universe should we fail and become the latest brainwashed, gene-altered and machine-grafted minions of the Overmind. Considering its plan to enslave and assimilate our species, we can view the other Aliens races, despite their induced hostility, as unfortunate slaves engineered into rapacious killers. They have been turned into biomechanical horrors against their will and are unfeelingly sent to die at our hands for a goal they can no longer comprehend. Outside the battlefield, they deserve our pity. On the battlefield, we must do our duty and preserve our planet.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Our mission now is not only to protect Earth and our species, but in addition to stop the Star-Spawn; we must prevent the Overmind from continuing its millennia-old campaign of conquest and subjugation.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Xenium Reactor</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>It became apparent in the early stages of this war that the alien menace had access to a better source of power than that utilized by earth-based technologies. This gap in the basic structure of our understanding of alien technology has hindered our efforts to determine an appropriate counter or duplication for artifacts in the alien arsenal. With the basic research into the structure of Xenium-122 completed, it became apparent what the aliens were using as a source of power. But how was this power source implemented? We in the science department believe we have uncovered the basis behind the UFO power source.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As was previously stated in the Xenium-122 report (see X-Net Entry: Xenium-122), Xenium-122 is best described as the physical representation of a fold in space-time. By placing the Xenium in a rotating set of magnetic fields electrons gather and can be extracted for use in powering systems. Although this method is extremely stable and produces large amounts of power, research into the Xenium Reactor shows that the immense UFOs reported by field agents use a slightly different system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In a large reaction chamber at the peak to the Xenium Reactor, a moderate amount of Xenium-122 is placed into a series of rotating magnetic fields. This allows the manipulation of gravity seen in all reported UFO sightings. Amazingly, the reaction chamber’s function does not stop there. By using a series of opposing-force magnetic fields the Xenium is brought from its normally stable state into a state of flux. In essence, this reaction ‘unfolds’ the Xenium part way, and allows it to snap back into its normal state. This reaction gives off a tremendous amount of power, far superior to normal Xenium power systems, and produces a strobe effect able to be seen through the reinforced composite reaction chamber! Though the reaction chamber seems to remain stable throughout the process, it should be emphasized that the reaction is extremely dangerous and a breach in the chamber wall would result in a catastrophic explosion. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Below the reaction chamber lays the alien 'battery'. The energy storage is accomplished through the use of a bio-organic mesh, not entirely dissimilar from the vaguely organic tissue found on alien composites. This mesh is composed of billions upon billions of synthetic neurons, normally in a dormant, un-energized state. Once energy is directed into the mesh, the system becomes active, sending along electrical pulses much like a living animal. The energy travels through these neuron strings past various relays in the system, each leading to UFO system components. When a relay is closed, energy continues through the mesh, perhaps for many cycles. When a relay is open, energy flows into that UFO subsystem. It should be noted that the opening and closing cycles on these relays seems to stagger energy as it enters a system, probably to prevent a power surge or overload in the system. Extended research of this mesh may prove useful, as there are a number of theories pertaining to the use of this battery mesh as computer core as well. It is possible that this mesh is in many ways the central nervous system of any ship. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>“Thank god we conducted the lab experiments outside today. Our entire computer system was fried just trying to control that thing. It’s like it was thinking, outsmarting our systems. Suddenly there was a power surge and the containment chamber almost breached. Bloody near killed us all." - David Williams, X-Corps Researcher</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Despite repeated attempts to synthesize the 'battery mesh', our laboratory efforts have met with failure. This development has led to the question of how an earth-based UFO power source could operate. At this time, even our best Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) batteries cannot store the full power given off by Xenium Reactor’s process. Attempts to store the energy by other, more unconventional methods have also met with failure. While it is possible to store a part of the power, while venting the rest through a capacitor and into ship systems, it is highly inefficient... and dangerous. Until a battery is developed that is able to handle the Xenium-122 reaction energy, the power must be vented, at least in part, directly into ships systems. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although the Xenium Reactor is a very effective and capable device, it is apparent that it is not capable of interstellar travel. It, like all engines earth has developed, cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This severely inhibits interstellar travel, implying that the aliens either originated from within our solar system, or that they have other propulsion systems. However, despite this information, it is still more effective than even the best human engines.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>UFOs have consistently outperformed all fighter planes currently available to X-Corps. This even includes next generation prototype fighters that are still on the drawing board. Several factors contribute to the UFO's edge over conventional fighters: the materials used in the construction of UFOs, the intricate zero lag-time pilot-craft interface, and the craft's powerplant. X-Corps Research and Development have managed to not only understand the principles behind all of those factors and replicate the necessary components, but also to modify them to our needs. We have now gained enough knowledge about these technologies to develop advanced craft with the attributes and capabilities of UFOs. As such, we recommend that priority be given to developing a new interceptor type craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>UFOs can withstand the extreme forces caused by the incredible manuevers that they commonly exhibit due to the Alien Composites used in their construction. The hulls and internal structures of UFOs are entirely constructed of the composite material, displaying no signs of mechanical manipulation such as any sort of cutting, welding or even the use of physical connectors such as bolts and rivets. This absence of weak points in the structure gives the UFOs' structure amazing resilience. It also lends credence to the "Hull Growth" theory of Alien UFO manufacturing - that the hull of an UFO is made by somehow growing Alien Composites into the needed shape, internal compartments and all. This unusual process results in a hull capable of taking an impressive amount of stress before losing structural integrity, but unfortunately, our scientists have yet been unable to induce growth of Alien Composites in order to duplicate this feat.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Alien Navigation system gives UFOs the true zero lag-time pilot-craft interface that is unmatched even by the A-Wave Control System used in the Gryphon. A mind/machine interface that bypasses the body enables the pilot to control the aircraft like it was an extension of his or her body, resulting in unparalleled responsiveness, such that a skilled pilot could evade missiles with ease.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, the heart of any aircraft lies in its power plant, and the same is true even for UFOs. Unlike human aircraft which rely on lifting surfaces and/or jet engines to generate thrust, UFOs rely on Xenium-powered reactors to generate gravity waves that provide both lift and thrust. Due to the fact that gravity waves can easily be manipulated by the reactor, it is capable of providing the necessary multi-vector thrust required for the impossible maneuvers that UFOs routinely execute. Also, their mastery of gravity waves allows the Aliens to nullify the effects of inertia, protecting the crew from the deleterious effects of excessive G-forces.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>These factors combined result in a class of craft that can easily dominate the skies, and even perform outside of atmospheres. As such, since we intend to defeat the Aliens, we have little choice but to incorporate their technology to develop craft with comparable specifications.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>ALIEN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Craft/Components/Navigation </paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>More of the Aliens' secrets have been exposed by our scientists; the uncanny methods the invaders use to pilot their vessels have been unmasked.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Certain components were discovered to be similar to those of other captured equipment, specifically the control interface. It appears that like nearly all of the Alien technology we have recovered, the craft are psionically controlled. Fortunately, the Alien technology is ultimately not too different from existing X-Corps technology. This coincidence makes it possible to easily adapt the extraterrestrial navigation array to Human thought patterns, and our pilots' combat experience with the XC-1 Gryphon enables them to adapt rapidly to the new technology. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>While conceptually the same, this equipment is only superficially similar to our own bio-feedback based AlphaWave technology. This psychotronic device appears to be some sort of gestalt network, linking up to five individuals of the same species to a massive psionic amplifier. Even psionically null individuals can be used in conjunction with this device.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The device seems to be able to operate with only one psionist of sufficient power, and with multiple weaker individuals being able to function in conjunction with the stronger operator. Unfortunately, including several stronger psionics in the link does not provide any greater advantage. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Apparently once the necessary threshold is reached, no further power is needed. One of the participants must be the focus of the psychotronic web; the controller. All other participants are virtually comatose for the duration of the link. When interfacing with the Alien control systems, the controller almost literally becomes the craft. Sensor readings are translated into sight, taste and sound, movement as muscle use, and damage as pain. Fortunately, the painful sensory input from damaged systems does not cause long term physical damage to the gestalt members. However, testing the results of craft destruction sensation is impossible, since the participants cannot survive the break-up of the vessel. All common stimuli from the body are overridden by the sensations of the vehicle itself. The non-operating participants share this flood of sensations, but are entirely passive; they have no control over the vehicle, and cannot even sever the connection to the controller. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, our experiments also contraindicate the use of ejection seats, as the abrupt severance of the navigator-craft link causes psionic feedback through the controller's prefrontal cortex, resulting in the equivalent of a high voltage lobotomy. It is theorized that the device actually creates a psionic connection between the operator and the living portion of the Alien Composites that the Alien vessels are made of.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The result of this unnatural bond is total control over the vehicle. Even an untrained operator can perform basic manoeuvres that would take months of practice for a conventionally piloted craft. A well trained navigator can perform feats once thought impossible. However, volunteer controllers linked with these devices for too long showed severe psychological problems, ranging from delusions of actually being the craft, symptoms similar to sensory deprivation, to psychological addiction to the sensations. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Several of our finest pilots are permanently hospitalized as a result. It is recommended that X-Corps personnel are not linked to the craft for more than 3 hours. Longer exposure to the device will cause permanent damage.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While is has proven impossible for our operators to mesh with captured Alien craft due to the differences in brain structure, we have developed a scalable hybrid control array, limited to a single operator. With this prototype, the strength of the sensory input can be controlled, limiting it to basic data during routine flight, but capable of unleashing the full sensory immersion required to combat the invader's vessels. Flying with this hybrid mode reduces long-term psychological damage by eighty-six percent. Unfortunately, involuntary dissolution of even this minor link still causes severe brain damage.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>"Whoa! The aliens have steak too? Cool!" ~Rookie X-Corps scientist on the human meat, promptly setting off projectile vomiting in the room.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>1. After detailed analysis of the food pods found within captured UFOs, we have found out much more about the alien diet. We had all expected that the aliens, although savage, would have a fairly normal diet by earth standards. The truth was more disturbing then we had ever thought.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>2. From studying the food pods on alien ships, we found out something very surprising. In some of the pods were broken down human flesh mixed with an enzyme that makes it more easily digestible, in an almost liquid form. In another were slabs of precooked human meat, in a form not unlike steak, [a finding backed up by the trace amounts of human flesh found in the bloodstream of certain aliens]. We also found cow organs in some pods. Our scientists theorize that the aliens mutilate the cows for specific tasty morsels, and leave the rest to rot, not unlike elephant poachers taking the ivy tusks and leaving the rest of the elephant to decompose. Another theory suggests that the aliens are doing this research on the cow's 3 stomach digestive tract in an attempt to find a way to digest tough plant foods, which in the long run it would make the aliens less dependent on humans for food on earth, and would enable them to eat the plentiful grasses and various grains found all over the earth. These findings of the cow organs in the containers bring us one step closer to finally solving the mystery of the cow mutilations. All of this shows that the aliens are trying to turn Earth into a slaughter house for meat... this new data will only harden X-corp's resolve, and us scientists have already thought up a few ways we can use this to our advantage...</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>2. Some of the pods contained human flesh broken down into an almost liquid form. It appears some type of enzyme is used to make solid foods more easily digestible. Solid slabs of uncooked human flesh, not unlike steaks, were also found, and DNA tests on alien blood samples did find traces of human DNA, confirming that the aliens do indeed consider us a food source. The digestive organs of cows were also found, causing us to theorize two different reasons. Either these organs are delicacies to the aliens, and they only take the specific parts they need, or they are studying these organs to learn a way to digest the tough plant matter that the three stomachs of a bovine digestive tract can handle. These are the leading theories as to why there are so many cow mutilations. If the aliens plan to use Earth as a slaughterhouse or feeding grounds, it will certainly harden our resolve to wipe out this alien threat.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>In order to fully appraise the true threat of the Alien species and understand the </paragraph>
        <paragraph>very nature of the Alien invasion, we must first comprehend the alien species themselves. Understanding more about Alien physiology, anatomy, and reproduction will probably aid us in this endeavor. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>During battlefield operations, X-Corps' soldiers have salvaged equipment that appears to be intricately tied to the aliens' life cycle. Most of this equipment was installed in special rooms and connected to each other in a network pattern. Among them there were some special devices which can best and only be described as incubators. These incubators contained a nutrient-rich artificial amniotic fluid in which fetuses in various stages of development were suspended. The liquid appears to facilitate the growth of the embryo inside. Cybernetic consoles assist in monitoring the embryos and ensure their proper development. The energy for their operation needs to be provided by an outside, continuous power source. In addition, incubators have a special conditioning system which keeps the temperature at a constant 314 Kelvin. Last but not least, two cylindrical receptors are located in one side of the incubator. Vials salvaged from the room fit these receptors perfectly. They are probably used for administration of medicines and nutrients. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>While conducting research on an one of these incubators, X-Corps scientists found further evidence that Ventriculant tissue is the primary factor in alien cloning, as the Ventriculant Autopsy report suggests. There were traces of Ventriculant tissue in the fluid, but not on the fetus. Upon closer investigation, younger fetuses had a higher Ventriculant to non-Ventriculant tissue ratio than older ones, strongly implying that Alien clones undergo a metamorphosis from Ventriculant tissue during their development. In order to produce a whole organism with different cell types, the aliens probably inject Ventriculant cells with different DNA strings, an in vitro procedure, which make the cells transform into various body parts, for example vital organs and skin. They are obviously able to use this method to create fully functional embryonic cell clusters that can grow into fetuses. Inside the incubators, fetuses have the energy, nutrients and growth-safe environment they need, indispensable premises for their complete and successful transformation. Hence, we nicknamed the whole room "Nursery Chamber".</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Aliens do not appear to be grown on ships, as the Incubators are securely and hermetically sealed to prevent contamination from outside factors. In addition, nursery chambers do not appear to have the equipment needed to either start or complete fetus growth, suggesting that they are only used to transport developing Alien fetuses to a more secure location to complete their growth, perhaps to a safer and more established area on Earth itself.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Based on the assumption that rapid growth of mature tissue is meaningless without an equally fast method of mental development since an orthodox education regimen would take at least months, if not years, to complete, we investigated further in order to discover how the Aliens are able to accomplish this feat. Alas, we haven't managed to solve this mystery. Maybe the answer lies in various small devices located inside the incubators. Unfortunately, by the time we try to remove them from the incubator, they appear to break down, preventing us from conducting research on them.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Since we are unable to observe the entire cloning procedure, we are unsure as to whether it is cost and time efficient. Yet, we strongly believe that this procedure is utilised as a factory-line system and the Alien invaders are able to generate the various alien clones they need (soldiers, scientists, pilots, engineers etc) in an accelerated time frame. Many scientific and military agents suggested that further research should be conducted in order to create the needed technology which will help us clone humans by utilising these nursery chambers. Alas, this idea was proven to be impossible to materialize. Setting ethical and practical issues aside, we face a yet unsolvable issue, despite our thorough scientific investigation. Attempts to integrate Ventriculant tissue with human DNA have been futile, as the cells stay idle. To understand why this is, we would probably need a lot more time than we have. We are confident, though, that after the war we will be able to answer this question.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>An Alien psionic wave generator which can induce hallucinations and visions for recreation purposes. It is, unfortunately, of very limited utility against the rising Alien threat. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Passive Psionic Projection Vision is a strange yet fascinating amalgamation of biology and technology, one step higher than the Alien Composites. The main component of the device is a sphere of Composites of 157.4mm in diameter. Microscopic seams of the organic components of Alien Composites are arranged, criss-crossing the sphere, resulting in a three dimensional, biological circuit. In essence, an extremely basic brain. When connected to a power supply, this “brain” will passively emit a low amplitude Psionic wave, causing an effect we have christened “Passive Psionic Projector Vision” or 3PV. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>3PV projects thoughts and images into the brain of any being with high enough psionic perception. Our studies have found that 3PV effects can range from simple hallucinations of objects, voices and music, to a complex, deep and complete simulation of reality. Participants across the higher ranges of psionic sensitivity have demonstrated coma-like states with extremely high levels brain activity. These particular individuals later report states of complete detachment from reality and high levels of emotional stimulation. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Our operatives noticed that devices aboard UFOs where often linked together along the walls of specifically constructed room. Investigation has shown us that, while the wave generated by a sole device is often be enough to cause 3PV, the level of any 3PV experience can be increased by implementing multiple devices. Amazingly, when connected in this fashion, the devices will automatically regulate and communicate with each other, dramatically enhancing the effect of the whole system.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>“Put together a prototype suit of armour or an experimental weapon, and the men avoid looking at you while mumbling about ‘danger’ or ‘injury’. Build an Alien Recreation chamber and ask for volunteers and suddenly they’re queuing all the way back to Section 2”</paragraph>
        <bullet> Dr. P McDowell, Research Operative, Sector 9</bullet>
        <paragraph>When Alien subjects are placed in a Recreation chamber, the response observed is similar to deep meditation or hypnosis, often coupled with high levels of endorphins. Subjects seem less aggressive and agitated after prolonged sessions and, incredibly, many Aliens will actually adopt changed patterns of behaviour if it means increased exposure time as a reward. Hence, and most surprising of all, we can only conclude that the purpose of the device is a form of recreation. This is particularly interesting because we had previously thought the Aliens to be devoid of the need for emotional and/or cultural stimuli. Though we can only speculate at its full use, that fact that Aliens might need, or even desire this type of technology is fascinating, and shows our two cultures may be closer than we realise.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Military value of Alien Recreation chambers is virtually non-existent. Training purposes, communication uses and psionic enhancement can all be ruled out, since visions cannot be controlled but are instead is unique to each individual; created from the test subject’s own thoughts and experiences. This characteristic can also lead to other, dangerous, problems, most notably the aggravation of deep-seated physiological problems and traumatic experiences.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The sensation is simply that of euphoria and bliss, much like a drug high, and thus Alien Recreation chambers have their real value on the commercial market, providing “opium for the masses” and revenue for X-Corps funding. Supply will be limited by the number of units we can find, however, since we have been, so far, unable to duplicate the incredible control over Alien Composites required for manufacture.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is, in fact, slightly concerning that the Aliens could succumb to these methods. These findings, coupled with the presence of projection chambers on Alien craft, have convinced us that there is more at work than simple entertainment. Indeed, there appears to be, on a grander scale, a sinister form of psychological control occurring. We recommend caution regarding commercial use of this project, as earlier described. </paragraph>

        <paragraph>ALIEN COMPOSITES</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Craft/Components/Composites</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The mystery of the unusual composite our operatives have brought back from the field has at last been solved. It seems it is not a true composite at all, but rather a number of discrete layers of metal, ceramic, and unusual hydrocarbons, each layer being just under 0.15 picometers thick. All but the outermost layer have a fine network of Alien organic tissue spread throughout, almost like a circulatory system. These 'capillaries' seem to center on uneven indentations on the interior of the material.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While many of the Alien devices are made of this substance, our analysis has focused on the scavenged hulls of captured Alien craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Early studies indicated that the outer shell of an Alien Composite-hull is manufactured to extremely fine tolerances, but minute variances in the internal layers show a more organic look. The external layer is a complex compound made up of Niobium, Osmium, Tungsten and Molybdenum mixed with traces of Platinum. The proportions must be precise, or the composite will not form. Within this composite is a complex molecular mesh of what appear to be reinforced silicon picotubes, supporting and surrounding molecules of buckminsterfullerene.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This combination gives the shell an incredible strength, unmatched by any earthly armor, as well as a distinctive oily sheen. Amazingly, the external surface of this husk is virtually frictionless, a side effect of the closely spaced buckminsterfullerene molecules. The internal metallic layers are made of the same compound, but with simpler reinforcement; a hexagonal network of carbon picotubes provides it both with strength and flexibility. While complex in both makeup and design, this layer is well within our engineers' capabilities.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The second layer is an unusual ceramic compound that exhibits superconductive properties even at room temperature. The effect of this layer on the Alien Composites is to enable them to disperse the blast of any energy attack throughout the entire skin of the device, allowing the heat of a laser or plasma burst to radiate away. It also serves to thoroughly insulate a craft from electromagnetic radiation. At extremely high temperatures, the ceramic begins to break down to a molecular level, losing its superconductive properties. Oddly enough, samples that have been tested to destruction seem to regain their superconductivity after a few days, with the damaged ceramic being completely regenerated. With access to our new low pressure calcination chamber, replicating this layer is child's play.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The third layer closely resembles terrestrial plastic, being hydrocarbon based. However, it contains several unusual molecular structures and a number of previously unknown enzymes, which can be easily reproduced in our laboratories. This plastic layer gives the entire structure a high level of resiliency, allowing it to flex and absorb kinetic energy quite effectively.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This sequence of layers is repeated hundreds to thousands of times, depending on the item in question. Whether it is the thin wall of a plasma-reaction chamber, or the impenetrable hull of an UFO, it is simply a matter of how many layers are added.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The most intriguing part of the Alien Composites is its organic portion. The tissue itself seems to be silicon-based, but altered immensely at the genetic level. The capillaries infiltrate each layer completely, with the outermost shell alone immune to its spread. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Incredibly, the organic segment seems to direct the placement and bonding of the other layers, with each layer somehow absorbed from a reservoir into the organic layer, transported molecule by molecule to the proper place, to be bonded with the existing region. Amazingly, this allows anything made of these composites to be essentially self-repairing as long as the external husk is intact and a sufficient source of the appropriate material is available. A controllable culture of this organic component is obviously the key to replicating this substance.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>While early experiments to reproduce the Alien Composites had disastrous results, we have managed to control the Alien tissue to the point of effective usage. With Composites manufactured by X-Corps’ engineers, there is no limit to what we can create.</paragraph>

We were already worried about him, but we came in the next morning, and...I dunno, he must have fallen asleep. It was like the stuff knew, or something, like it knew he was trying to destroy it.

        <paragraph>BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ROOM</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.Net/Alien/UFO Components/Biological Research Room</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>An analysis of a recently recovered UFO has revealed a new application of Alien technology. A new kind of room was found, and it’s purpose is clearly that of an operating theatre. The exact nature of the "operations" performed here is not entirely clear, but we have been able to make educated guesses based on the tools and materials found. To our best knowledge, large animals and even humans are brought into this room and surgically opened, followed by removal of tissue and sometimes even of whole organs.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The room contains a precision laser cutter suspended over a large table. The operating table is formed of a biomimetic nanopolymer. When the Alien's quarry is taken to the room, this substance extends pseudopods to restrain the subject's limbs, thus effectively rendering it immobile while the subject remains conscious during its operation. Most experiments are conducted then, with no anesthesia or further restraints. That coupled with the fact that this apparatus does not appear to have any form of pain control has led us to believe that the Aliens do not use it on their own kind. Instead, it seems that subsequent to the Alien abductions that are becoming all too common, the Aliens remove or add certain organs.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The laser appears to be operated via the control console. Alas, it is quite simple, almost inadequate for critical surgical excisions. We suspect that the cutting device can be remotely controlled. Nevertheless, it allows the operator to fine-tune the ray up to 4 micrometers. It can be focused to almost any power or width at will, and will cause any exudated bodily fluids to evaporate. This instrument could revolutionize the future of medical treatment - if we can survive this war.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Humans and animals alike are in danger of these strikes, as the Aliens appear to abduct indiscriminately. What they do with these organs is thus far unknown. They may use them for academic purposes, chemistry, or even food. The containers we found in these rooms contained so much material that we think it is safe to assume that they are not used for research purposes alone. More likely it is a harvesting process, probably followed by some kind of processing of the removed tissue and organs.</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>"So we walked into this room and there were, like, all these glass tubes with weird things floating in them, and the light was kinda flickering, and it was really really spooky, and then suddenly there was this sound to my left, and when I turned, I saw this pale, long-legged creature jumping towards my face... well, and I shot it before it could latch onto me and inject me with alien eggs so that a few days later some alien baby wouldn't burst from my chest and leave me dead on the floor... It all went kinda fast, sir..."</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>While thousands of people all over the world claimed to have been captured by Aliens, few were believed prior to the beginning of the Alien War. It becomes obvious now that some, if not all, of those reported abductions may have actually taken place, for our soldiers have made a horrible discovery: certain rooms discovered in UFOs appear to be designed to hold humans in order to conduct experiments on them.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>These areas contain specialized medical equipment, ranging from simple but frightening saw-toothed scalpels and self-cauterizing drills to tools that have been identified to be deep tissue samplers and fetus-extracting tools. The uses of other equipment can only be imagined. All of this equipment is highly advanced, and most of it appears to be suited for microinvasive procedures, featuring automatic wound-sealing mechanisms that hardly leave a trace on the bodies subjected to this "surgery". A large trapezoidal table usually dominates one side of the room. This table has built-in temperature regulators and integrated multi-parametric monitoring of vital functions. In addition, it has the incredible capability to mold itself to the examined subject. Our own surgical operating rooms could be improved greatly by using them. Unfortunately, the Aliens' use of surgery does not appear to be beneficial to the subject.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Numerous transparent containment chambers are located in the room, used for storage of tissue and organ samples. Several vessels have been found to contain illuminated tanks as well, some containing human organs, some containing fetuses, possibly results of Alien experimentation on humans. It is a mystery how these chambers preserve the enclosed tissue, as no support or cooling mechanism can be identified.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This Alien facility’s use is frighteningly similar to the stories many victims had claimed. Apparently, surgical and genetic experimentation has been performed on our citizens - perhaps for decades. We suspect that implantation of bio-mechanical devices, tissue extraction and total organ removal are common occurrences within these walls. Even more frightening is that from what we can tell, hybrid fetuses, created from combining Alien tissue with reproductive material taken from other victims, are implanted in human women and, after growing for several months within the involuntary host-mother's womb, extracted for unknown purposes. We have even recovered one hybrid fetus from a poor soul found dead within a captured vessel. No living hybrid fetuses have been successfully retrieved.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Devices have been found that function as synaptic interrupters, causing loss of all voluntary motor function. Apparently they are placed on the subject's head for more delicate surgeries. It gives a lot of insight about the Aliens' attitude towards us, however, that these interrupters do not inhibit pain. It should also be noted that no evidence for any kind of narcotics or amnesia-inducing substances has been found, which suggests that the Aliens have some other way of wiping or altering the victims' memories.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Xenium 122</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>What powers the alien technology we’ve seen, and how does that power source relate to the apparent ability of alien craft to generate anti-gravity fields? This question has often plagued the scientists here in the research department. After the study of captured UFO materials, we are finally able to answer that question even if complete understanding remains elusive.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Research into the UFO power supply has revealed a synthetic material unlike anything ever before seen on Earth. Given the name Xenium 122, (as it was our 122nd experiment which rendered understanding of the material’s basic functions), this compound both supplies power and allows the creation of anti-gravity waves so essential to the alien propulsion systems.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Xenium is best described as a fold in space-time. When folded in this manner, space-time apparently becomes solid allowing it to be seen and touched. As the Xenium is utilized it shrinks. Once the Xenium is completely used up the fold in space-time “falls flat”, reverting space-time to its normal state and leaving no trace of Xenium’s existence behind. Despite constant research, we are unable to grasp even the basic concepts on how one would synthesize this substance. Unfortunately this places the control of Xenium firmly in the aliens’ hands for now. This monopoly must be broken if we are to win this war.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In its most basic, unrefined state Xenium 122 seems to clump together in a crystalline structure, similar to quartz crystals. These crystals emanate a strange orange glow, an iridescence that is completely unexplainable, and might be a result of the creation process used by the extraterrestrials.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When Xenium 122 is placed in a rotating magnetic field, it creates a field unlike anything humanity has seen. This field exhibits many properties, but its foremost ability seems to be that it can warp, and even nullify gravity. The rotating magnetic field acts as a “control field” manipulating the Xenium’s field like a steering wheel. Using a set of such fields, one can warp space and travel in the non-linear fashion required for practical space travel. While creating solely Xenium 122 based drive systems is unlikely at this time, the Xenocide science department heavily suggests research into the creation of system to manipulate this property of Xenium.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Another powerful property of Xenium 122 is its ability to give off a charge. This charge gathers at the magnetic poles of the field and can be drawn off to create a constant supply of electricity. The charge given off by Xenium is sufficient to keep the control field in place as well as power other systems.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately waste particles, radioactive and otherwise, are given off during this process. In addition to the beta radiation, other nuclear particles are given off during this process. Protons are present but neutrinos in particular are emitted in large quantities. These particles must be caught, or vented, creating a dilemma when considering its use as a power source. With the proper system, Xenium creates a large power output, which is then used to power ship systems with the excess being stored in a battery. Waste particles are then captured in a containment system or vented into the air. It should be noted that the charge produced in this manner is tremendous, and we are unable as yet to create a battery that successfully stores the all the power output of Xenium. This proves to be more and more important, as Xenium itself is used up during the aforementioned processes. The use of Xenium must therefore be carefully monitored lest we completely use up this precious material on trivial matters.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>One other property of Xenium 122 was discovered while researching particle bombardment testing. Certain catalysts used for bombardment destabilized the Xenium samples. This mixture of Xenium and catalyst particles would lead to the creation of energized plasma and may be the basis for the plasma weapons seen wielded by aliens in the field. Further research into this area of Xenium 122 usage is recommended.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>“Proceeding with experiment number one hundred twenty-two. Material remains stable. No discernable change in alien material. Okay Carl, you can shut down the… wait a minute! Yuri, increase the power on fields one through thirteen… come on, come on! Jacobs, focus the camera at grid point sixty-seven. Damn it, Yuri! Tighten that field! Wait! NO! Don’t let it go! Amazing.

        <paragraph>PROBE UFO</paragraph>
        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Craft/Probe</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The tiny size of these alien craft has caused a heated debate about whether they are actually piloted or just unmanned drones. X-Corps has come to name them "Probes" for this reason.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although the Probes' hull is not saucer-shaped, a casual glance at the craft in flight might give the impression of possessing rotational symmetry due to its dome-shaped main body, lined with a slightly glowing propulsion system. The craft/drone discussion has been resolved when we learned that in fact a single alien pilots the Probe. The interior is claustrophobic and coffin-like, barely large enough for the lone pilot, with hull-integrated controls, alien devices and glyphs of mostly unknown purpose. R&amp;D recommends that X-Corps soldiers should refrain from trying to operate or touch any of them in the field.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In our analysis, we were not able to find any modular components. Apparently, the Probe's propulsion and navigation systems are completely integrated into the ship itself. While this is a very efficient design, it prevents us from learning any further details about the alien technology. The integrated design is also the reason for another important weakness: The Probe's power systems rely on exterior dissipation of excess energy. When engaged in high-speed maneuvering, the surplus energy is dispersed through the hull, resulting in a blue corona around the whole craft. WWII pilots have already described the same glow effect. Simulations indicate that once this method of energy dissipation is compromised by otherwise negligible-seeming exterior damage, the vessel is most likely consumed in a matter of seconds by its own propulsion system, just like reported by X-Corps pilots.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The swift, agile Probes rely on stealth and agility to accomplish their missions, often going completely unnoticed. Unarmed and only lightly armored, the threat these craft pose is not terror and destruction, but surveillance and espionage. Probes appear to be commonly used to scout areas of interest, exploring and recording vast amounts of data about target zones before the deployment of larger vessels. These alien surveys apparently include everything from basic geographic information to population size and local technology. This data is then most likely used for threat estimations and, the most terrifying prospect, for determining the ideal locations for local colonization. Wherever this small craft appears, follow-up missions with more dangerous UFOs are sure to follow.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>UFO sightings dating back to World War II can probably be attributed to these vessels. Reports show a remarkable similarity, although the reported UFO sizes differ wildly, and indicate that these variations are corollary of very inaccurate distance estimations caused by the vessel's incredible maneuverability. Historically dubbed "foo fighters", these Probes have obviously been used to scout our planet for decades.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>The smallest of the armed alien craft, the Recon UFO seems to have been a common visitor to our world.  Virtually all of the UFO sightings through the mid to late twentieth century fits the description of these small, one or two room ships.  Though given the name 'Frisbee' due to the disc-like shape of the most commonly encountered configuration, this class of scout ship comes in many forms.  Like the smaller Probe vessels, the purpose of this vessel is exploration rather than simple military conquest.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>With only a light weapons complement, this craft is more likely to flee a confontation than stand and fight.  However, like a trapped rat, its small plasma cannon gives it a nasty bite.  Although unlikely to be able to destroy an XC-1 in a dogfight, one of these vessels is more than capable of inflicting enough damage to ground the intercepter for weeks, or simply leave it vulnerable to other UFOs as the plane returns to base.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Containing several banks of delicate scanning equipment, this classic flying disc usually sweep the airspace ahead of larger craft for potential threats, but they can also perform initial research on terrestrial organisms.  Often found grounded in rural agricultural areas, the crew will take samples of local flora and small fauna to conduct preliminary experiments upon, with a typical crew consisting of only five or six extraterestrials. When downed, these craft pose only a minor threat to an experienced X-Corps team.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This vessel is best downed with conventional weapons, from maxiumum range.  This way our intercepters can remain undamaged, and still leave the majority of the craft intact for recovery after a hard landing.  More powerful weapons should only used if a recovery mission is unlikely as little, if anything, of use will remain.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A sole reactor, usually mounted centrally in the main room, powers these crafts.  In an undamaged ship, our operatives can expect to find limited amounts of the alien composite and supplies.  The most useful substance carried by this class of ship is the small amount of exotic substances and materials used to power the vessel.</paragraph>
      </body>
      <fluff>
        <paragraph>While the military threat presented by a Recon-class UFO is minimal, it is imperative that we disrupt the Alien research and reconnaissance as much as possible.  We must take any steps possible to attempt to slow their invasion force, regardless of how futile it may seem.  The constant increase in UFO sightings and interceptions force us to consider the frightening possibility that these small ships are merely the vanguard of a much greater extraterrestrial threat.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>    The largest of the scout class vessels, the Escort shares in the common duties of other small ships. Several of these craft working together are often pressed into service as an escort for a larger ship.  This sort of support can eliminate a careless interceptor easily, and is a definite threat to even a full wing of XC-1s.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>    This vessel can defend itself ably, with high chance of the attacking X-Corps craft taking damage.  However, these ships are not much more heavily armored than their mid-sized cousins, and can be eventually be  brought down with conventional weapons.  </paragraph>
        <paragraph>    While they tend to be about twice as large as a Recon Vessel, the crew compliment isn't much larger.  Even with only seven or eight creatures usually found aboard this type of alien craft, its complex internal configurations are often well designed for defense. A small team of Alien commandos is almost always part of the crew, and this group often take cover outside the vessel while the rest attempt to repair it.  Capturing one of these on the ground is a difficult task for even a well trained task force.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>    Usually containing only a single power source, these vessels are often less manuverable than their smaller brethren. However, the pair of small plasma cannon mounted amidships more than makes up for the loss if agility in a firefight.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>    An Escort-class vessel contains a significant amount of alien technology for its size, often making it worth the effort needed to bring it down.  The hull armor will generally protect the most valuable items, even during a crash landing.  This can work against us though. Should the reactor be damaged, the assault team may find only a hollowed out shell.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>X-Net://Pegasus.net/Alien/Craft/Reaper</paragraph>
      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>Though the Reaper specializes more in harvesting raw animal tissues than in aerial combat, it is a definite upgrade from the Recon and Escort UFOs we encountered in the early months of the Alien invasion.  Capable of maintaining nearly twice the velocity and sustaining five times the damage of our XC-1 interceptors, the Reaper may signal the beginning of a frightening trend towards larger, more dangerous Alien ships.  Charged with gathering animal specimens and tissue samples for its Alien Harvest Mission, this extraterrestrial craft can competently defend itself with several medium-range plasma weapons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Reaper’s reinforced substructure houses an enormous gravity manipulator able to exert fine control over gravitational fields.  Virtually the entire bottom floor is dedicated to this prominent device; direct conduits from several Xenium Reactor cores are necessary to meet the colossal power requirements of the manipulator.  This device, used solely for the Alien’s harvesting process, is only effective at low altitudes and short ranges.  This limitation, combined with prohibitive energy consumption, prevents the gravity manipulator’s adaptation for military purposes.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>There is no denying the potency of the device, however; the gory carcasses the Reaper leaves in its wake are unmistakable.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Once unseen gravitational forces raise the unsuspecting creature from the ground, wildly fluctuating gravitic distortions literally flay the poor creature in mid-air, rapidly separating desired tissues from the detritus.  These tissues are then levitated to a sample bay on the underside of the craft, leaving the lifeless remnants to litter the landscape.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>An unpleasant stench of blood pervades the interior of the craft, and dimly lit corridors make for tense battle conditions.  Environmental hazards abound, especially on the first floor: the Xenium Reactors and the gravity manipulator’s arcing energy conduits can rupture and explode with even a single careless shot.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The second level of the Reaper is devoted to tissue and cell processing; samples collected by the gravity manipulator are purified and refined on this floor.  Cold, sterile walkways wind around the array of machines where various tissue samples are culled and extracted.  Chosen cellular components are conveyed directly into large, transparent storage vats, while the remaining tissues are routed to devices specializing in the hybridization of terrestrial proteins, DNA, and RNA with complementary Alien versions.  The resulting chimeric products appear to be used for other Alien purposes.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Above the tissue processing level is the third and final level, containing the command and navigational control center- the heart of the Reaper.  It is here that our marines usually meet stiff resistance from Aliens determined to defend their ship to the last.  Killing the leader and taking the command center will almost certainly reduce the morale of any Alien stragglers. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Though the Reaper's primary functions revolve around its Alien Harvest Mission, it possesses surprisingly potent defenses, and its sheer size can make securing the craft a long, grueling affair for our marines.  This craft is definitely one that should not be underestimated.</paragraph>

      </shortentry>
      <body>
        <paragraph>After extensive research on the new UFO Type we discovered, it seems that we are dealing with a highly specialized craft. The Collector UFO seems to be designed for one sole purpose: research on the Human race. Target persons are kidnapped and experimented on, and while there is evidence that some abductees have been returned to Earth, all suffer irreversible memory loss of the events that took place inside the Alien craft .</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Collector can be classified as a medium sized craft featuring an uncommon design compared to other UFOs. In the centre of the ship, a floor opening is found, leaving a big hole in the UFOs hull. Interestingly the flight abilities don’t seem to be compromised by this uncommon feature. The Collector is nearly as manoeuvrable as and even a little bit faster than other medium sized UFOs although only equipped with two power sources. The board armament features a single relatively short ranged high gain plasma cannon with medium firepower. The Collector's interior houses interesting medical equipment which needs further research.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A maximum of eighteen crew members can be expected inside an undamaged craft, which is a fairly small compliment of Alien troops for a craft of this size. Nevertheless these shock troopers should not be under estimated, as the most experienced alien soldiers are chosen for these missions, presumably to ensure that the humans are taken alive, not dead.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Aside the skillful design of this craft, the interior shows a horrifying scene to those who dare to enter.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Even a battle-hardened soldier might tremble when opening the doors and stepping into the gruesome Alien Medical Rooms, displaying entire galleries containing the remains of the poor souls examined by the Alien medics; unwilling participants in life despising experiments, often mutilated beyond recognition. Some of the victims are dead and preserved, some are still alive and in unimaginable states. It appears that even the Aliens' technology was pushed to the limit to keep these subjects alive to finish the extreme surgical procedures they underwent.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unfortunately, all the abductees perished long before the craft was secured for our medical units.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The heart of this ship seems to be found in that part we call “Alien Medical Room”. Someday, we may be able to use the various instruments found in there for benefit of mankind.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>On the bottom of the vessel some type of “tractor beam” - a device using electromagnetic radiation or anti gravitational technology of some kind to move objects through the air - can be found, presumably used to lift up the abducted without the need of ground contact. This tractor beam, based on a version of the grav lifts which can be found inside the larger UFOs, pulls the subject into a small room, where we suspect the first person to person contact with the abductor beeing established. Unfortunately we do not understand how to operate or block the device as of yet, since we are unable to bring sense in the writings on the board we suspect to be the console.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Interestingly the Aliens prefer to land and set down a group of “hunters” before committing the actual abduction, presumably to ensure the safe boarding of the target. We suspect, that the tractor beam cannot be used on moving persons.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>We suggest a prioritization of X-Corps activities to protect the civilian population. Just like alien terror missions, although most of the abductees do not know what happened to them, alien abductions have a profound psychological effect on the public, which may compromise national governments and in turn, X-Corp funding. Despite the resulting tactical risk, we recommend UFO's to be engaged, and captured/destroyed whenever possible before they are able to conduct their gruesome mission.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The Alien Juggernaut is quite possibly the deadliest threat X-Corps pilots will ever ever have to face. In addition to being nigh unstoppable, it often carries a large complement of high ranking crew and has displayed a zealous readiness to engage our most heavily equipped forces. Juggernauts should be engaged as far from bases or civilian population centers as possible. The use of advanced technology is a need, as terrestrial craft and weaponry fare very poorly against these dangerous capital ships.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The colossal dimensions of the Alien Juggernaut dwarf all other ships in comparison. From prisoner interrogations and analyses of captured design documents, it is clear that we are dealing with a vessel that can match, if not easily outclass, anything we can currently produce. Apart from being extremely well armed and well armored, Juggernauts are also one of the fastest Alien vessel classes we have encountered. Earth-based fighters would have to be launched from near the Juggernaut’s intended destination to attempt a risky head-on assault.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In aerial engagements, the Alien Juggernaut sports several massive weapon systems that our engineers have dubbed 'Quantum Projection Cannons'. These fearsome weapons easily outrange and outperform any terrestrial Air-to-Air weapon in the X-Corps’ inventory, including Titan missiles. When an United States Air Force patrol of F-22 fighters attempted to intercept one of these Juggernauts, the entire wing was obliterated before they could close to weapons range. All available information regarding these ‘Quantum Projection Cannons’ is insufficient to even attempt to replicate or understand, they appear to be some kind of super-heavy plasma cannons; their construction may possibly involve some deep relation with Xenium-122 which we have not been able to decipher. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>It is recommended that Alien Juggernauts be intercepted simultaneously by multiple fighters, in the hopes that the multiple threats will split the Aliens’ aim long enough to inflict enough damage and take the massive ship down. If the threat to X-Corps bases is deemed low, an alternative course of action is to allow the mammoth vessel to land and then assault it with ground forces. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Leaders of Juggernaut ground assault missions should be highly experienced and well-trained to mitigate the extremely high risk of casualties. We can deduce from their devastating heavy weapon systems, thick armor and sheer size that these Alien vessels serve as the capital ships of their fleet. They are likely to be among the most heavily-crewed ships, serving in troop transport functions as well as in combat roles. They also appear well-suited for ground assaults on targets such as civilian population centers and, most disturbingly of all, X-Corps bases.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In addition to direct combat roles, we hypothesize that these flagships are also used to establish new Alien bases in remote locations and transporting high-ranking Alien creatures. The Alien Juggernaut has the potential to cause irreparable harm to our cause, and it must be defeated at every opportunity... in spite of the costs. </paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>While Alien intentions involve humanity in a variety of ways, the Intimidator seems focused on one solitary aspect: the spread of terror among humankind. The Intimidator, capable of annihilating a standard interceptor in a single coordinated blast, is designed to identify large and relatively undefended populations, then to strike the most vulnerable site and to collect both living and dead human specimens.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Even by itself the size of an Intimidator can generate a feeling of dread. Its bulk is covering a large area on many levels, in order to be almost entirely self-contained for its purposes. It is protected by a very thick and tough layer of Alien material, which prevents almost any damage to the ship from the outside. Protruding its surface, sensors and weapons can be identified in key locations all over the ship.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Intimidator houses a very large crew complement, powerful weapons, numerous engines, and a huge number of specialized rooms. Heavily defended and safely tucked inside the Intimidator's heart is the command center from which orders are coordinated and dispatched to the terrorist units. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>While some rooms accommodate the crew, others contain cryogenic pods where creatures designed specifically for terror attacks are kept in stasis, ready to be awakened at a moment's notice. These rooms are defended by frightening heavy weapon platforms programmed to destroy any intruder with ruthless precision. Other specialized rooms are probably used to keep conscious, immobilized victims transfixed in a state of sustained horror during their terrible trip to an Alien base, where is uncertain what abominations might await for them.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The weapons room is impressive, containing complex weapons systems powered directly from a large Xenium reactor. Our research has confirmed the incredible range of ship's massive weapons, and Interceptor pilots are strongly advised to engage this nightmarish ship at the furthest ranges possible.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The large engine rooms are reserved for highly redundant engine systems, which are able to function even after sustaining heavy damage, making the ship almost unstoppable. Also, they are powerful enough to accelerate the ship to speeds far beyond our Interceptors capabilities.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>After researching the ghastly purposes behind the Intimidator's design, our sense of moral outrage demands that our main priority is to prevent these vessels from fulfilling their inhumane missions.</paragraph>

      <body>
        <paragraph>The Aliens’ presence on Earth remains a mystery, and we are left with many unanswered questions. What is their objective? Where did they originate? How did they get here? Although, X-Corps research has given us some understanding into the Alien Freighter’s technical capabilities and presumed purpose, we still can only guess where these hulking craft hail from.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Taking the Alien Freighters’ floorplans into consideration, it appears that these ships were designed specifically with maximum transport capabilities in mind, as each floor houses enormous cargo holds and modularly-integrated storage containers. With only a small section is dedicated to ship functions, it is obvious that command, weapons control systems and armor plating were scaled back in favor of vastly increased storage space. Additionally, the ratios between the Freighter’s power systems and humongous mass appear ridiculously small, and maneuverability is severely impaired. The result is a lumbering ship of massive proportions: an Alien Freighter at full capacity is just barely capable of sustaining its top speed. Essentially, this ship is a gigantic flying warehouse, poorly armored and slow in comparison with other Alien vessels.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>However, pilots intercepting these Alien craft should not assume that these ships are easy targets. The Freighter’s sheer size and bulk allow it to absorb a surprising amount of damage before being its armor can be penetrated and the ship taken down. Critical components are buried deep inside the ship, and damage to cargo areas will go unnoticed during an aerial battle. In fact, terrestrial aircraft have been known to break off pursuit after simply running out of ammunition. </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although the Alien Freighter is well armed for a supply ship; power constraints limit the effective range of its weaponry. Nevertheless, Gryphons venturing too closely to this behemoth have often been seriously damaged or even destroyed outright. Skilled pilots have learned long ago to maintain a safe distance from this craft.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>According to our research, Alien Freighters are designed solely for space travel at sub-light speeds. Given their low speed and barely adequate ship systems, we can presume that these vessels are being constructed and launched from a site in the local interstellar vicinity, likely from within our own solar system. Furthermore, the immense cargo capacity for the Alien Freighter has been a cause for speculation, and we can now assume that the majority of these Alien supply vessels are en route to establish Alien bases here on Earth. If this is indeed the case, disrupting Alien supply lines by intercepting these Alien Freighters could dramatically slow their onslaught. Additionally, our personnel over the Engineering Division is has requested X-Corps High Command to prioritize Alien Freighter recovery missions, as these ships are often heavily laden with valuable construction materials such as the unique and very scarce Xenium-122 </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Yet, low-risk opportunities to recover intact Freighters are virtually nonexistent, as these ships have a tendency to only land near Alien bases. Alternatively, if our intercepting craft manage to force one to land prematurely, we have a better chance to successfully capture it, though the inflicted damage drastically reduces the viability of much of the cargo. Navigating through the Freighter’s cluttered storage holds is tricky business; small corridors and containers filled with unknown substances make it a less than ideal setting for close quarter combat. For instance, a stray plasma bolt might do as little as heat up a segment of the Freighter’s hull, or as much as releasing clouds of toxic vapors from pressurized tanks or ignite a fiery conflagration from vats filled with volatile chemicals. Although assaulting this type of vessel presents environmental hazards that can vary according to the cargo within its holds, we possess two distinct advantages. Firstly, the Alien crew of these supply ships is generally lightly armed and poorly equipped. Secondly, the Alien Freighter’s command center is largely indefensible due to design limitations. As a result, any Alien resistance that our troops might encounter here can easily be crushed by a coordinated attack using grenades and automatic weaponry. </paragraph>
